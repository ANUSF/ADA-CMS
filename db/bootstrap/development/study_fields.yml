    The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.
    
    In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.

    The object of the surveys, conducted in New South Wales and South Australia in 1965, was to gain some idea of the social and economic situation of persons identifying as Aboriginal in the more closely settled regions of Australia.
    
    Data on households covered household composition, including sex of head of household, visitors, duration of residence, location of dwelling, type of dwelling, land ownership, rent and payments, details of type of construction, facilities, utilities, furnishings and appliances, consumer durables and books/musical instruments, interior and exterior care and maintenance and whether dwellings condemned.
    
    Data on individuals included housing, age, sex, marital status, race,
    relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
    whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
    education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
     
    Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.
    
    Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.

    The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.
    
    In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.

    This survey of the New South Wales subset, is a follow-up to a 1965 study which investigated a sample of New South Wales and South Australian Aboriginal households. The aim of this second wave was to examine changes that had occurred in social and economic conditions since 1965.
    
    Topics investigated include household composition, ownership and physical characteristics of the dwelling and details of visitors; health including child mortality, ante-natal and infant care, use of health services and medical insurance; education, literacy, employment, hospitalisations, trade union membership, income (individual and household), assets, and chief recreation. Attitudinal questions asked were related to schooling, health services, Aboriginal languages, Aboriginal land rights, political parties, police, officials of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme, the Aboriginal Health Service, changes since 1965 in the economic situation of Aborigines, and local Aboriginal leadership. 
    
    Demographic variables covered age, sex and relationship to head of household.

    non-probability sample
    
    This survey is the second wave of a study begun in 1965, which investigated a sample of Aborigines in New South Wales and South Australia.
    
    The present survey was aimed at re-interviewing all the New South Wales cases included in the 1965 survey.  New South Wales households interviewed in 1965 were contacted, and new households established by members of 1965 households were traced and contacted.  Information on people who had died since 1965 was obtained, in part because the proportion and causes of Aboriginal deaths were considered to be significant indicators of Aboriginal conditions.
    
    The selection of the 1965 sample was aimed at representing fairly all non-metropolitan areas of the State.  For this purpose New South Wales was divided into five regions: North Coast, South Coast, South West (Cowra to Deniliquin), West (Wellington to Wilcannia), and North West (Dubbo-Collarenebri) except for Moree and Walgett.

    The purpose of this study was to list and describe all images, including cartoons, of Indigenous people between the given dates in a sample of newspapers from Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide. Related textual information was also included.
    
    The resulting computer-readable text file contains a standardised entry for each image. Descriptive fields include the title and date of the newspaper, title of the image and page on which it is located, name of artist/engraver/photographer, size of image, description of scene (activity/background/dress/ accessories), title and author of related text, location and name of tribe, type of image (advertisement, cartoon etc.), city of origin of newspaper, and related information.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data has been retained in its original format because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The purpose of the study was to obtain information on adult deaths which were reported to have occurred while the person was serving a non-custodial correctional order.  'Non-custodial correctional orders' included all orders which involve some form of supervision of a person by a correctional authority, outside an institution.  It was intended that the results of the survey could be used to assist in placing into a broader perspective the data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths obtained by other research studies of the Royal Commission.
    
    Topics covered in the present study included the time and manner of the individual's death, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), characteristics of the individual's correctional order, and use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables included geographical location, and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal), marital status, employment status, mental health history, physical health history, most serious offence, and correctional history of the individual.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ADA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ADA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The study aims to provide information on deaths which occurred in police and prison custody throughout Australia in the 1980s, in order to place the phenomenon of aboriginal deaths in custody in the broader context of all deaths in custody during the period.
    
    Topics covered include the time, environment and cause of the death, amount of time since the last inspection of the prisoner, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), and characteristics of the custody (legal status, number of days in custody, custodial authority).  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender, and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ADA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ADA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The study aims to provide information on deaths which occurred in police and prison custody throughout Australia in the 1980s, in order to place the phenomenon of aboriginal deaths in custody in the broader context of all deaths in custody during the period.
    
    Topics covered include the time, environment and cause of the death, amount of time since the last inspection of the prisoner, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), and characteristics of the custody (legal status, number of days in custody, custodial authority).  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender, and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ADA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ADA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody. The purpose of the study was to obtain information on self-inflicted harm in custody.  The interest was in both attempted suicide (whether the person actually intended to die from the attempt or not) and other forms of self-harm, such as lacerations.  It was intended that the information could be used to help develop policies and practices that may reduce the incidence of self-inflicted deaths in custody.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the time, place and form of self-injury, the immediate reaction of custodial staff and subsequent action (e.g. bail to attend hospital, counselling), and the use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables include geographical location and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or nonaboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Police filling out surveys were asked to provide the following details on detainees - age, sex, time of lodgement and release from cell, reason for detainment and release and whether the detainee is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ADA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ADA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is the third in a series of police custody surveys recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and provides information on those being taken into custody and held in police cells or related secure police detention facilities.
    
    Police filling out surveys were asked to provide the following details on  detainees - age, sex, time of lodgment and release from cell, reason for  detainment and release, most serious offense and whether the detainee is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ADA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ADA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

  value: "A national survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services (Byrne, Garwood, Moorcroft, and Barnes, 1995) in Australian libraries, followed by case studies in a select number of libraries. \n\n\
    This project concerns a series of good practice protocols by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network (ATSILIRN) in 1995. The Protocols were developed to guide libraries, archives, and information services to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities which the organisations serve, and\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Handle materials with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content.\n\n\
    A literature search indicates that a number of organisations (both LIS and non-LIS based) refer to the protocols but there is no evidence of any research conducted into the relevance and application of the protocols at an institutional level.\n\n\
    A research team at the University of Technology Sydney, endorsed by ATSILIRN, conducted a study into the practical implementation of the protocols across Australia. All relevant library, archive and information service institutions were invited to take part in a national survey. The researchers will follow this up with a study of innovative or exemplary practices to further assist institutions in applying the protocols.\n\n\
    It is anticipated that the research will be used to compile a number of reports covering but not limited to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Relevance of the protocols at local, regional and national institutions\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Issues and concerns of institutions relating to Indigenous issues.\n\n\
    Papers are also planned for national and international conferences with the aim of enlisting support for a consistent approach to Indigenous materials held in libraries, archives and information services."
