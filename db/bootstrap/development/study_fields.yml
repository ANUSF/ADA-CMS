    This survey of the New South Wales subset, is a follow-up to a 1965 study which investigated a sample of New South Wales and South Australian Aboriginal households. The aim of this second wave was to examine changes that had occurred in social and economic conditions since 1965.
    
    Topics investigated include household composition, ownership and physical characteristics of the dwelling and details of visitors; health including child mortality, ante-natal and infant care, use of health services and medical insurance; education, literacy, employment, hospitalisations, trade union membership, income (individual and household), assets, and chief recreation. Attitudinal questions asked were related to schooling, health services, Aboriginal languages, Aboriginal land rights, political parties, police, officials of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme, the Aboriginal Health Service, changes since 1965 in the economic situation of Aborigines, and local Aboriginal leadership. 
    
    Demographic variables covered age, sex and relationship to head of household.

    non-probability sample
    
    This survey is the second wave of a study begun in 1965, which investigated a sample of Aborigines in New South Wales and South Australia.
    
    The present survey was aimed at re-interviewing all the New South Wales cases included in the 1965 survey.  New South Wales households interviewed in 1965 were contacted, and new households established by members of 1965 households were traced and contacted.  Information on people who had died since 1965 was obtained, in part because the proportion and causes of Aboriginal deaths were considered to be significant indicators of Aboriginal conditions.
    
    The selection of the 1965 sample was aimed at representing fairly all non-metropolitan areas of the State.  For this purpose New South Wales was divided into five regions: North Coast, South Coast, South West (Cowra to Deniliquin), West (Wellington to Wilcannia), and North West (Dubbo-Collarenebri) except for Moree and Walgett.

    The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Profiles (ACPs) are tabulations giving key census characteristics of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons, families and dwellings, covering most topics on the 1991 Census of Population and Housing form. This profile is presented at the Aboriginal Community level. 
    
    The ACP consists of 29 tables which crosstabulate characteristics including gender, age, place of birth, religion, marital status, education, income, occupation and employment status.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The study aims to provide information on deaths which occurred in police and prison custody throughout Australia in the 1980s, in order to place the phenomenon of aboriginal deaths in custody in the broader context of all deaths in custody during the period.
    
    Topics covered include the time, environment and cause of the death, amount of time since the last inspection of the prisoner, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), and characteristics of the custody (legal status, number of days in custody, custodial authority).  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender, and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The study aims to provide information on deaths which occurred in police and prison custody throughout Australia in the 1980s, in order to place the phenomenon of aboriginal deaths in custody in the broader context of all deaths in custody during the period.
    
    Topics covered include the time, environment and cause of the death, amount of time since the last inspection of the prisoner, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), and characteristics of the custody (legal status, number of days in custody, custodial authority).  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender, and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  Since some 60 per cent of the Aboriginal deaths in custody being investigated by the Royal Commission occurred in police custody, it was considered important that data be available on the numbers and characteristics of people held in police cells in Australia.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the timing and reasons for the individual's placement in custody and removal from custody, and whether the individual was alone or with others during custody.  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  Since some 60 per cent of the Aboriginal deaths in custody being investigated by the Royal Commission occurred in police custody, it was considered important that data be available on the numbers and characteristics of people held in police cells in Australia.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the timing and reasons for the individual's placement in custody and removal from custody, and whether the individual was alone or with others during custody.  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
    whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
    education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.

    non-probability sample
    
    The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.
    
    In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.

    Data on individuals included housing, age, sex, marital status, race,
    relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
    whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
    education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
     
    Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.
    
    Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.

    'Viable' parliamentary candidates for 24 March 1990 Australian federal election. Because of the large number of independent and minor party candidates who stood in the election, the survey is not based on a sample in any conventional sense. To be eligible for selection, candidates had to meet one or more of the following criteria: 1. Endorsed candidates of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, National Party, Australian Democrats, and the Nuclear Disarmament Party
    
    2. Candidates with labels explicitly identifying them as environmentally concerned (except the Australian Green Party )    
    
    3. Candidates who were endorsed by significant Green pressure groups
    
    4. Other candidates who it was anticipated would obtain more than 10 per cent of the first preference vote

    Candidates for the House of Representatives and Senate in the Federal election were surveyed, as in the Australian Candidate Study, 1987.  In 1990, however, the survey was restricted to candidates for the major parties - Labor, Liberal, National and Australian Democrat - plus candidates standing on green and environmental platforms; other minor party candidates and independents were not included.  
    
    The study examines the political issues prevalent in the election, replicating some of the questions on the economy, the environment, social issues and industrial policy which were asked in the Australian Election Study, 1990 (SSDA No. 570).  These include candidates' attitudes to particular economic issues, attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general.  A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care, and many others.  A section on women focuses on women's issues, support for women, attitudes to women and attitudes to women as election candidates.  This will enable extensive replication to be conducted focusing on mass-elite linkages, both across the electorate as a whole, and disaggregated by party. 
    
    In addition, the survey asks questions relating to political background, including electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations, together with questions on pre-selection, such as the support which the candidate was given to gain nomination.  A section on campaigning asks for candidates' perceptions of the personal attributes and experience which they think are required to make a successful candidate and MP, and the activities that the candidate engaged in during their campaign. 
    
    Data collected on social and political characteristics of candidates, plus certain social and political features of the electoral divisions in which they stood (for House of Representatives candidates only), has been linked to the candidates' questionnaires.  However, due to confidentiality provisions, only subsets of these variables can be provided for analysis.  The variables are: house contested; state; electoral division*; party affiliation; sex; occupation; whether elected or not; first preference vote in 1990 election*; position on ballot; incumbency status; years in parliament; ministerial status; number of candidates on ballot; median income in electoral division*; urban-rural location of electoral division*; two-party preferred vote in 1987 in the electoral division; two-party preferred vote in 1990 in the electoral division*.

    Candidates for the House of Representatives and Senate in the Federal election were surveyed, as in the Australian Candidate Study, 1987.  In 1990, however, the survey was restricted to candidates for the major parties - Labor, Liberal, National and Australian Democrat - plus candidates standing on green and environmental platforms; other minor party candidates and independents were not included.  
    
    The study examines the political issues prevalent in the election, replicating some of the questions on the economy, the environment, social issues and industrial policy which were asked in the Australian Election Study, 1990 (SSDA No. 570).  These include candidates' attitudes to particular economic issues, attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general.  A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care, and many others.  A section on women focuses on women's issues, support for women, attitudes to women and attitudes to women as election candidates.  This will enable extensive replication to be conducted focusing on mass-elite linkages, both across the electorate as a whole, and disaggregated by party. 
    
    In addition, the survey asks questions relating to political background, including electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations, together with questions on pre-selection, such as the support which the candidate was given to gain nomination.  A section on campaigning asks for candidates' perceptions of the personal attributes and experience which they think are required to make a successful candidate and MP, and the activities that the candidate engaged in during their campaign. 
    
    Data collected on social and political characteristics of candidates, plus certain social and political features of the electoral divisions in which they stood (for House of Representatives candidates only), has been linked to the candidates' questionnaires.  However, due to confidentiality provisions, only subsets of these variables can be provided for analysis.  The variables are: house contested; state; electoral division*; party affiliation; sex; occupation; whether elected or not; first preference vote in 1990 election*; position on ballot; incumbency status; years in parliament; ministerial status; number of candidates on ballot; median income in electoral division*; urban-rural location of electoral division*; two-party preferred vote in 1987 in the electoral division; two-party preferred vote in 1990 in the electoral division*.
    
    *for House of Representatives candidates only

    self-completion (mail out, mail back)
    
    The survey was mailed to the candidates on 3 April 1990, ten days after the election. The envelopes contained an individually-addressed and signed letter explaining the purposes of the study and a guarantee of confidentiality, the questionnaire, and a return postage-paid envelope. In addition, a letter of introduction from party leaders was included in the mailings to Labor Party and Australian Democrat candidates. Approximately one week later a thank you/reminder postcard was mailed to all those included in the survey.
    
    A follow-up of all survey respondents who had not returned questionnaires or who had not indicated that they wished to be excluded from the study was conducted six weeks after the election. The follow-up envelope consisted of an individually-addressed and signed letter re-stating the purposes of the study and emphasising confidentiality, another questionnaire, and a return post-paid envelope.

    The principal objectives of the Rights in Australia project were: to establish the level of support for civil liberties and civil rights among Australians; to determine the firmness or solidity of Australians' attitudes to civil liberties; to explore how Australians make up their mind in specific civil liberties controversies, especially where there are competing sides to a situation; and to identify principal characteristics which might affect the support or rejection of certain civil liberties.  The first stage of this project consisted of the surveying of a representative sample of the Australian population (SSDA No 618). The present stage comprises interviews with a 'decision makers' sample - individuals from two groups, the legislative sample (members of major political parties) and the legal sample (judiciary and executive officers including public servants, public prosecutors and police officers).
    
    The decision makers survey consisted of a telephone interview, followed by a questionnaire distributed by mail.  The telephone interview began with questions designed to establish a general measure of the respondent's attitudes to equality of rights and tolerance of actions against the government.  This was followed by a section dealing with more specific rights issues - freedom of speech, racial discrimination, and freedom of choice, including censorship, euthanasia, abortion and homosexuality.  Further sections dealt with: legal rights - right to trial, right to trial by jury, contact with the police; sexual discrimination; racial prejudice towards Asians and Aboriginals; and the issue of a Bill of Rights for Australia.  The mail survey consisted of additional questions covering the same range of issues.  In the telephone interview, background information was collected on political orientation, vote at last election, interest in politics and compulsory voting.  Participants from the legislative sample were not asked the political involvement series of questions.  
    
    Demographic information collected about the respondent included age, sex, country of birth and year of arrival in Australia, citizenship status, age starting and leaving school, type of school attended, highest qualification, religion and frequency of church attendance, marital status, numbers of children and numbers in the household, occupation and labour force status, trade union membership and household income.

    The principal objectives of the Rights in Australia project were: to establish the level of support for civil liberties and civil rights among Australians; to determine the firmness or solidity of Australians' attitudes to civil liberties; to explore how Australians make up their mind in specific civil liberties controversies, especially where there are competing sides to a situation; and to identify principal characteristics which might affect the support or rejection of certain civil liberties.  The first stage of this project consisted of the surveying of a representative sample of the Australian population (SSDA No 618). The present stage comprises interviews with a 'decision makers' sample - individuals from two groups, the legislative sample (members of major political parties) and the legal sample (judiciary and executive officers including public servants, public prosecutors and police officers).
    
    The decision makers survey consisted of a telephone interview, followed by a questionnaire distributed by mail.  The telephone interview began with questions designed to establish a general measure of the respondent's attitudes to equality of rights and tolerance of actions against the government.  This was followed by a section dealing with more specific rights issues - freedom of speech, racial discrimination, and freedom of choice, including censorship, euthanasia, abortion and homosexuality.  Further sections dealt with: legal rights - right to trial, right to trial by jury, contact with the police; sexual discrimination; racial prejudice towards Asians and Aboriginals; and the issue of a Bill of Rights for Australia.  The mail survey consisted of additional questions covering the same range of issues.  In the telephone interview, background information was collected on political orientation, vote at last election, interest in politics and compulsory voting.  Participants from the legislative sample were not asked the political involvement series of questions.  
    
    Demographic information collected about the respondent included age, sex, country of birth and year of arrival in Australia, citizenship status, age starting and leaving school, type of school attended, highest qualification, religion and frequency of church attendance, marital status, numbers of children and numbers in the household, occupation and labour force status, trade union membership and household income.

It also provides information about the degree of disability associated with mental health problems and the extent to which children and adolescents are receiving help for their problems.
    
    Information was collected from children aged 4-17 and their parents. Children and parents completed questionnaires assessing mental health problems (assessed using the Youth Self-Report and Child Behaviour Checklist) health related quality of life, health-risk behaviour and service utilisation. In addition, parents completed a face-to-face interview (3 modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) designed to identify Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Conduct Disorder.

    The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the Employment Initiatives Program (EIP) in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects. The Program was a short-term job creation scheme set up by the Victorian Government in 1982.
    
    File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.
    
    File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.
    
    File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 
    
    Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.
    
    File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent's general impressions about the EIP job creation program.
    
    Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.
    
    The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.
    
    The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.

    weighting criteria With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each "rest of state" area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspapers Releases and Computer Sheets.
    
    weighting procedures The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.

    multi-stage sample with age and sex quotas
    
    The survey is conducted over a four week (monthly) period to gain a total monthly sample.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of over 200 small clusters of households throughout the six states and two territories.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.
    
    The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to each of Australia's Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to enrolment figures for April 1984.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electorates.
    
    At the next stage of the design, within each electorate, a number of electoral sub-divisions are chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to the chosen April 1984 Electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.
    
    Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector's district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.
    
    At the final stage, within each selected collector's district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is twelve effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and two clusters of six effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.
    
    Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 14 years and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.
    
    All types of dwellings are called upon and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called upon in its place.

    The 1990 EEO Public Sector Survey was conducted to determine progress under the EEO program since the last survey in 1985 and to provide information about employment patterns and opportunities within the New South Wales public sector. The study was designed to provide representative information on the employment experiences of women, Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background and people with physical disabilities in the public sector.
    
    Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects, differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of minority groups, training and development courses and own education. Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and details of any disabilities were also recorded.  The questionnaire asked respondents about their experience (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.
    
    Background variables include age, sex, birthplace and educational status.

    Weighting criteria
    
    The sampled agencies are weighted based on known workforce figures so that they are represented in proportion to their representation in the Public Sector workforce as a whole.
    
    Weighting procedures
    
    Weights for results were calculated separately for females, for males and for when sex was not specified to increase precision and reduce bias towards the female workforce due to higher response rates from women.
    
    F - workforce number of females
    f- number of female respondents
    M - workforce number of males
    m - number of male respondents
    u - number of respondents of unknown sex
    uf - estimate of the number of female respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:
    
    uf = f / (f+m) * u
    
    um - estimate of the number of male respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:
    
    um = m / (f+m) * u
    
    Weights are:
    for females            Wf = F / (Uf +f)
    
    for males               Wm = M / (Um +m)
    
    for sex unknown    Wu = (F+M) / (f + m + u)
    
    TAFE included their part-time staff in the sample, and due to there being significant differences between part-time and full-time staff, and for female and male staff, the results were further weighted by whether staff were employed full-time or part-time.

    The 1990 EEO Public Sector Survey was conducted to determine progress under the EEO program since the last survey in 1985 and to provide information about employment patterns and opportunities within the New South Wales public sector. The study was designed to provide representative information on the employment experiences of women, Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background and people with physical disabilities in the public sector.
    
    Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects, differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of minority groups, training and development courses and own education. Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and details of any disabilities were also recorded.  The questionnaire asked respondents about their experience (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.
    
    Background variables include age, sex, birthplace and educational status.

  value: The method of distribution varied and depended on the size and geographic spread of the organisation. In smaller agencies questionnaires were usually distributed by hand, while in larger agencies they were distributed by mail. In some agencies self-completion in a group setting occured.  Respondents were given the option of using return mail, placing the questionnaires in ballot boxes or handing them to appointed officers.

    The Australian Candidate Study, 1987 was undertaken in conjunction with the Australian Election Survey, 1987 (SSDA Study No. 445), in order to provide a comparison between the attitudes of the candidates and of the electorate, and to obtain information on the candidates' political background and the support for and obstacles to their candidacy, with a special emphasis on women candidates.
    
    Questions on candidates' political background include dates of previous candidacies at local, State and Federal level and when elected; when interest in politics began; length of current party membership and of any previous party membership; voluntary or community organisations involved with; party activities undertaken before becoming a candidate; number of nominees for the candidacy and the number of women nominees. Information was sought on who first encouraged the candidate to stand; the support of family and friends; main source of financial support; obstacles to nomination; negative aspects of the candidacy; and the importance of leaders to the election outcome. Women candidates were asked about their party's attitude towards women candidates; their relations with the women's association of the party; the support received from other women in the party, women's organisations and women politicians; and the importance of women's issues. A section on election issues covered reduced taxes vs. increased social services; the power of trade unions and big business; consumption tax; defence spending; privatisation; uranium mining; marijuana legislation; abortion; benefits for aborigines; law and order; Asian migration; testing for AIDS; opportunities for women; and left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties.
    
    Background information includes age, place of birth of self and parents; year arrived in Australia; age left school; level of qualification; occupation; employment sector; years lived in the electorate; marital status; number of children; partner's occupation; religion and church attendance; union membership; sex; candidate's party; electorate; position on ballot; whether Representatives of Senate candidate; whether incumbent and whether elected.

    The Australian Candidate Study, 1987 was undertaken in conjunction with the Australian Election Survey, 1987 (SSDA Study No. 445), in order to provide a comparison between the attitudes of the candidates and of the electorate, and to obtain information on the candidates' political background and the support for and obstacles to their candidacy, with a special emphasis on women candidates.
    
    Questions on candidates' political background include dates of previous candidacies at local, State and Federal level and when elected; when interest in politics began; length of current party membership and of any previous party membership; voluntary or community organisations involved with; party activities undertaken before becoming a candidate; number of nominees for the candidacy and the number of women nominees. Information was sought on who first encouraged the candidate to stand; the support of family and friends; main source of financial support; obstacles to nomination; negative aspects of the candidacy; and the importance of leaders to the election outcome. Women candidates were asked about their party's attitude towards women candidates; their relations with the women's association of the party; the support received from other women in the party, women's organisations and women politicians; and the importance of women's issues. A section on election issues covered reduced taxes vs. increased social services; the power of trade unions and big business; consumption tax; defence spending; privatisation; uranium mining; marijuana legislation; abortion; benefits for aborigines; law and order; Asian migration; testing for AIDS; opportunities for women; and left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties.
    
    Background information includes age, place of birth of self and parents; year arrived in Australia; age left school; level of qualification; occupation; employment sector; years lived in the electorate; marital status; number of children; partner's occupation; religion and church attendance; union membership; sex; candidate's party; electorate; position on ballot; whether Representatives of Senate candidate; whether incumbent and whether elected.

    The 2007 Australian Candidate Study is the eighth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2007, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.
    
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on demography and representation includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy and referendums
    
    In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. 
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.

    The 2007 Australian Candidate Study is the eighth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2007, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.
    
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on demography and representation includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy and referendums
    
    In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. 
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.

    The Australian Values Study was undertaken as part of a major international survey to compare fundamental values in different countries throughout the world. It focuses on such areas as attitudes towards work, life satisfaction, family, political, moral, religious and spiritual values, and a wide range of social issues.
    
    Variables include participation in leisure activities; membership of groups; attitudes towards others; important aspects of a job; working hours; attitudes towards current work, job-sharing, early retirement, unemployment and technology; satisfaction with marriage, friends, religion and standard of living; goals in life; religious beliefs, practices and experiences; marital and family details; comparisons with spouse and parents; personal financial details; attitudes towards finance and the economy, politics, society, trade unions, the nuclear debate, drugs and alcohol, test-tube babies, patriotism and aborigines. 
    
    Background variables include age, sex, birthplace, nationality, languages, level of education, employment status, approximate income, occupation, details of main income earner, household pets, home ownership, type of dwelling and size of town.

    area-cluster sample with sex quota
    
    The Australian Values Study used a probability sample of approximately 1200 Australians in both country and city areas.
    
    Interviews were conducted within each of the 110 electoral sub-divisions chosen at random within 13 strata based upon the six states and the two territories, split into urban and rural categories.  Within each of these subdivisions, one elector's name was selected at random.  The residence adjoining this elector's was the first contact dwelling and further adjoining dwellings were approached until the quota of ten interviews was filled.
    
    People were selected at each dwelling for interviewing by a method which produces accurate cross-sections of each sex and age.  The smaller states, Tasmania, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory were over-sampled to make interstate comparisons possible.

    Topics include: whether Federal and State governments are doing enough for Aborigines; whether the respondent agrees with a World Council of Churches report that "racism is entrenched in every aspect of the Australian society"; whether Aboriginal people living on reserves should be given freehold land; whether the respondent would rather see New Zealand compete at the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane or the Third World nations who threaten to withdraw if New Zealand is allowed to compete; attitudes to overseas investors; between unemployment and inflation, which is the greater problem in Australia; whether tariff protection for Australian industries such as the motor vehicle and clothing industries should be reduced; and for women, whether she is responsible for all or most of the household shopping, whether she is employed, and approximately how much money is spent weekly on food and groceries.
    
    Background variables include: age; sex; marital status; level of education; country of birth; household composition (number of persons in household, number children under age 5, number children between 5-12 years old, number children between 13 and 17 years old, age of the youngest person, and number of employed persons); whether respondent has moved in last two years; tenure of dwelling; occupation of self and head of household; voting enrolment; vote intention; income; and telephone ownership.

    weighting criteria
    
    With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each metropolitan Statistical Division and in each "rest of State" area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspaper Releases and Computer Sheets.
    
    Whilst the survey is conducted only in private dwellings, it is assumed that people living in non-private dwellings such as boarding houses, hospitals, hotels and motels have similar characteristics to those living in private dwellings.
    
    weighting procedures
    
    The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.

    multi-stage cluster sample with age and sex quotas
    
    The survey is conducted on the first two weekends of the month.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of 150 small clusters of households throughout the six states and the ACT.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.
    
    The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to 124 Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electorates.
    
    At the next stage of the design, within each Electorate, a number of Electoral Sub-Divisions is chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to latest electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.
    
    Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector's district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.
    
    At the final stage, within each selected collector's district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous Monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is ten effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and five effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.
    
    Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 16 and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.
    
    All types of dwellings are called on and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases, the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called on in its place.

    The 2001 Australian Election Study is the sixth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2001 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody. The purpose of the study was to obtain information on self-inflicted harm in custody.  The interest was in both attempted suicide (whether the person actually intended to die from the attempt or not) and other forms of self-harm, such as lacerations.  It was intended that the information could be used to help develop policies and practices that may reduce the incidence of self-inflicted deaths in custody.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the time, place and form of self-injury, the immediate reaction of custodial staff and subsequent action (e.g. bail to attend hospital, counselling), and the use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables include geographical location and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or nonaboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.

    The New South Wales Recorded Crime Data is a compiled record of crime data obtained from NSW police records. The data covers the annual periods 1996 to 2005 and incorporates information on crime incident, person of interest (i.e. person suspected or accused of perpetrating the crime) and victim of the crime.

    The Australian Candidate Study, 1987 was undertaken in conjunction with the Australian Election Survey, 1987 (SSDA Study No. 445), in order to provide a comparison between the attitudes of the candidates and of the electorate, and to obtain information on the candidates' political background and the support for and obstacles to their candidacy, with a special emphasis on women candidates.
    
    Questions on candidates' political background include dates of previous candidacies at local, State and Federal level and when elected; when interest in politics began; length of current party membership and of any previous party membership; voluntary or community organisations involved with; party activities undertaken before becoming a candidate; number of nominees for the candidacy and the number of women nominees.

  value: The 1996 Australian Candidate Study is the fourth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates.  In 1996, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, and the Greens.  The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia.  Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought.  A section on national identity includes questions on national pride, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and citizenship.  In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations.  A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources.  ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.

  value: The 1996 Australian Candidate Study is the fourth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates.  In 1996, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, and the Greens.  The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia.  Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought.  A section on national identity includes questions on national pride, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and citizenship.  In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations.  A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources.  ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.  Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with.  Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.

    The 2007 Australian Candidate Study is the eighth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2007, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.
    
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on demography and representation includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy and referendums
    
    In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. 
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.

    Summary details of political parties which have won more than 2 percent of the vote or won a seat at any of the general elections, showing their share of votes and seats, and the various electoral forums in which they have run candidates.
    
    This information and further notes about the Western Australian Legislative Assembly can be found online at The Australian Politics and Elections Database http://elections.uwa.edu.au
    
    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentages first preference vote shares. No swing information is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Liberal Party and Ministerialists
    During the 1890s and early 1900s, factional politics began to give way to political groupings and electoral organizations which foreshadowed the emergence of modern political parties. The term Ministerialists is applied to groupings which, for a variety of reasons, supported a particular government but were not bound by party discipline. By 1911, the emergence of the Labor Party had the effect of polarizing parliamentary politics to that '[v]irtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 223, label the Forrest ministry as 'Protections or Conservative', but the terms reflect the predisposition of the Premier and his supporting group rather than a party organization.
    
    At the 1894 election, the existence of '... a reigning ministry gave [the election] a sharper focus than that of 1890, but it was still predominantly a matter of each candidate running his own campaign with the aid of a local committee. Although Forrest had occasionally called meetings of his supporters in Parliament over the previous four years, there is no evidence to suggest he had any say in the nomination of candidates', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 72.
    
    At the 1876 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Forrest government were more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent' in the table above (see see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 74). Campaigning was undertaken by various trade union groups which would form the basis for the Labor Party at future elections; see generally, H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 341-387, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035); pp 318-321 provide commentary on the 1897 election.
    
    At the 1901 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Throssell government and its policies were becoming more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent', in the table above, although '... many candidates had only the loosest connection with either the Ministerialist or the Opposition group', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 569. The success of candidates affiliated with the labour movement was to hasten the development of modern partisan politics; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    At the 1904 election, politics began to be polarized between Ministerialist candidates, some of whom ran as 'Liberals', and those affiliated with the labour movement; those candidates who ran as Liberals '... were supported by the National Political League formed in March 1904', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570. For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    The 1905 election '... completed the trend towards a two-party Assembly which James [the previous Ministerialist Premier] had encouraged the year before. The Independents all either lost their seats or were driven into the arms of the Ministerialists, who won 35 of the 50 seats .... As was occurring elsewhere in Australia at about the same time, parliamentary politics became permanently established as a conflict between Labor and non-Labor, in preference to other possible patterns', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    By the 1908 election, the success of the Labor Party had had the effect of encouraging the creation of a single non-Labor grouping. 'Although the term 'Liberal Party' did not come into general use until 1911 ... there were two "clearly opposed and fairly evenly balanced political parties" [reference to Hyams, see below]. Virtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor. The degree of non-Labor unity within parliament was not immediately paralleled by the formation of an integrated extra-parliamentary organization ...', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    For a detailed study of non-Labor politics in this period, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354, at pp 346-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035), and note B K Hyams, 'Western Australian Political Parties, 1901-1916', University Studies in History and Economics, [University of Western Australia], 2(3), September 1955: 48-61.

    Liberals for Forests: At the 2001 Election Janet Woollard was elected to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2001, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2001 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2001, ISBN 0730761010), also online at : http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010]).

    Labor candidates: 
    
    The 1901 election is the first election for the Legislative Assembly at which candidates were elected who was affiliated to the labour movement. The votes for these candidates are shown as being votes for the Australian Labor Party even though such an organization had not yet been formed. Several bodies competed to represent the labour movement; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p.82); and H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    Candidates affiliated with labour organizations contested 33 electoral districts at the 1904 election and won 22 seats, more than any other party grouping. The party was able to gain enough parliamentary support after the election to replace the James Ministerialist government with a minority Australian Labor Party government; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: p.88; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In the 1905 Election,'Labor was caught ill-prepared and its representation shrank to 15, but the establishment of a clear two-party system of which it was the most sharply defined member, was certainly to its long-term advantage', see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    The split in the Australian Labor Party over the issue of conscription in 1916 had led to a number of its Assembly members defecting to form a National Labor as part of the Nationalist Coalition government which supported conscription; see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, at pp. 369-373, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).

    At the 1921 election, the Australian Labor Party regained some of its electoral support, much of this being at the expense of National Labor Party members who continued to support the Nationalist Coalition government.

    Democratic Labor Party: The Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement suffered major internal divisions in the 1950s which came to a head in 1955 with a split in some state branches of the Party and the creation of what was to become the Democratic Labor Party; for an extensive study of this period, see Robert Murray, The Split: Australian Labor in the Fifties, (Melbourne: Cheshire, 1972, ISBN 0701516755).

    Democratic Party: This party fielded five candidates at this election. It was formed in 1968 and favoured a free enterprise system, opposition to government funding of non-government schools, and a range of other policies; see Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, p.82 (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217) [Jaensch and Mathieson refer to this party as 'Democratic Party (3)' to distinguish it from other parties with the same name].?
    Independents: 'During the term of the Leake ministry (1901 to 1904), the Government and Opposition drew closer together; by the 1904 election the old Forrest 'Conservative' group had become 'Independents' in name', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570.
    
    The Independent member elected at the 1993 election was Elizabeth Constable, who retained the seat of Floreat which she had won in a by-election as an Independent in 1991; Constable viewed herself as an Independent Liberal having originally run for election as the consequence of a factional dispute over candidate endorsement within the Liberal Party.
    
    The three Independents elected at the 1996 election were Ernest Bridge (Kimberley) who had defected from the Australian Labor Party in 1995 after having been the Labor member for Kimberley since 1977; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) who regarded herself as an Independent Liberal since the time of her first entry to the Assembly in a by-election in 1991; and Phillip Pendal (South Perth), who had been elected to the Assembly at the previous election (1993) as a member of the Liberal Party, and sat after this election (1996) as an Independent Liberal.
    
    The vote shown for Independents at this election (2001) is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (54) and those candidates who ran for office without any registered party name (5), a total of 59 such candidates.
    
    Three of the Independent candidates were elected in the 2001 Election, (four if the Liberals for Forests candidate Woolard is included; see Liberals for Forests). Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Phillip Pendal (South Perth) were re-elected as Independents (sitting as Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Larry Graham, who had been denied endorsement by the Labor Party for the seat of Pilbara, ran as an Independent candidate and won the seat.
    
    The vote shown for independents at the 2005 election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (39) and two candidates who ran for office without any registered party name, a total of 41 such candidates.
    
    Two of the Independent candidates were elected; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Janet Woollard (Alfred Cove) were re-elected. Constable sat as an Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Woollard, in spite of being being elected under the banner of the unregistered Liberals for Forests party in 2001, and this party label being registered as a political party in 2005, ran as an Independent at this election (2005); see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2005, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2005 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2006, ISBN 1920886664); also online at: http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010].

    The Liberal Party was also affected by the issue of conscription and the First World War; some of its Assembly members saw themselves as being affiliated with such newly formed Nationalist organizations as the National League, while others campaigned as Liberals who were part of the Nationalist Coalition government; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 197-198 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In this database, former Liberal candidates who campaigned with the support of the National League are referred to as affiliated with the Nationalist Party even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Liberal Party and Liberal and Country League: In 1949, a public meeting '... attended by several hundred people from various parts of the state approved the formation of the Liberal and Country League (LCL) .... The Liberal Party agreed to submerge its identity in the new party...' David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p.218 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Black argues that this change of name was part of a continuing struggle between the Liberal Party and the Country Party; see David Black, 'The Liberals Triumphant: The Politics of Development 1947-1980', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 441-470, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819). 
    Liberals for Forests: Janet Woollard was elected  at the 2001 Election to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Green in 'Sources', below details). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    Country Party: 'The decision of the FSA [Western Australian Farmers and Settlers Association] to form a third political party was taken in 1913 and grew out of the belief among farmers that their interests were neglected by both the existing parties, Labor and Liberal', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 159 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495); for a survey and analysis of the rise of country parties across Australia, see B D Graham, The Formation of the Australian Country Parties, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1966).
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Under Premier Mitchell, the Country Party members became increasingly dissatisfied with the conduct of the Nationalist Coalition government but '... the party had not yet found a formula enabling it to combine its independent identity with its membership of coalition government', Layman, p. 164.
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Some candidates affiliated with the Country Party chose to run without any commitment to the National Coalition government.
    
    Tensions within the Country Party over its role in the National Coalition government of Premier Mitchell led to strains between the Primary Producers Association (PPA) and Country Party members of parliament. In 1923, these disagreements came to a head with the executive of the PPA refusing to endorse several sitting Country Party members. As a consequence, the Party split between those who supported continued close cooperation between Country Party members and the National Coalition (the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party), and those who wished Country Party members to follow a more independent line (the Executive Country Party). Both these groups fielded candidates at this Legislative Assembly election (1924).
    
    For details of this Country Party split, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819), p. 105.
    
    The creation of the United Party meant that there was only one group which claimed the name Country Party for this Legislative Assembly election (1927); on the Country Party during this period, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    The Country Party had suffered a major split in 1923 but had undergone a major reorganization to rebuild its electoral base and parliamentary support in the years leading up to the 1930 election. Its defeat at the 1936 election condemned it to another stint on the opposition benches see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 164-167 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    At the 1944 conference of the Primary Producers Association (PPA), a motion was passed which terminated the administrative arrangements through which the Country Party had been the political wing of the PPA. Its newly acquired political autonomy required the party to create its own organization and source of funds. As part of this reorganization, the party changed its name to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 167-170 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Country Party and Country and Democratic League: The Country Party had changed its name in 1944 to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; the parliamentary party -- but not the organization -- reverted to the name Country Party in 1949. But the party faced strong competition from the Liberals and lost three seats at this election (1950); see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    After the electoral changes of 1947, demographic trends and competition from the Liberals, the Democratic League struggled to maintain its representation; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495.
    For the political context of this election (1953), see David Black, 'The Liberals Triumphant: The Politics of Development 1947-1980', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 441-470, at pp 445-447, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see Lenore Layman, 'Continuity and Change 1947-1965', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 153-183, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    National Alliance and Country Party: In the face of dwindling electoral support and vigorous competition from the Liberal Party, the Country Party merged with the Democratic Labor Party to form the National Alliance '... an unlikely union given the very different social roots and political concerns of the two', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.183 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Not all Country Party parliamentary members joined the new party, and some candidates had joint endorsement for both the Country Party and the National Alliance, three members were elected with National Alliance endorsement (H J Cowan, A V Crane, and W P McPharlin), two with joint endorsement from the Country Party and National Alliance (R C Old and P Jones), and one with endorsement from the Country Party alone (M E Stephens).
    
    The poor performance of the fused party led the Country Party to revert to its previous name and organization after the 1974 election; support for the Democratic Labor Party had collapsed after the election of the Whitlam Australian Labor Party government in Canberra in 1972. 
    National Country Party and Country Party: In response to tensions within the party, and in a further attempt to redefine its role and broaden its electoral appeal, the Country Party changed its name in 1975 to the National Country Party; for context and analysis, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.184 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084)
    A split within the National Country Party in 1978 led to '... the existence of two parties: the larger and more conservative National Country Party (NCP), the Liberals' coalition partner, and the smaller, more radical National Party (NP) playing a cross-bench role. The 1978 split was the culmination of a period of uncertainty as the party tried a number of strategies to arrest electoral decline', Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at p. 109 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084).
    As foreshadowed by Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at pp 116-118 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084) the parties started a process of reunification in 1984 which was completed by 1986 under the name of the National Party of Australia (in this database the name National Party is used for the reunited party to simplify comparisons with other states and to conform to common usage). Not all parliamentary members of the National Country Party accepted the terms for reunion; for brief a comment on the consequences of reuniting the party, see Harry Phillips, 'The Modern Parliament, 1965-1989', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 185-262, at pp 226-246, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839) p. 232.
    
    United Party: The split in the Country Party in 1923 led to the existence of two Country parties, the Executive Country Party, and the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party. The Majority Country Party, '... after an unsuccessful attempt to form their own Independent Country Party, joined with the National League [Nationalist Party] and the remnants of the National Labor Party to form the United Party', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 202 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). At the election, individual candidates campaigning under the banner of the United Party maintained their links to Nationalist or Country Party organizations.?
    Nationalist Coalition The realignment of parties in 1916-1917 led to the creation of a Nationalist Coalition comprising all non-Labor groupings .The Nationalist Coalition had features of both a coalition and a political party and is treated as a single partisan affiliation for the governments of Western Australia between 1917 and 1924. The component groupings maintained their separate identities and became increasingly autonomous after 1917.
    
    The Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Coalition government had been formed as part of the realignment political support that had been prompted by the conscription crisis and the First World War. The Nationalist Party had absorbed most of the support of the Liberal Party but had only a fragmented organization and its relationship with the Liberal League was unclear. Members elected as Nationalists were dominant in the Nationalist Coalition government of Mitchell  (1921 to 1924); see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 98 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and see 'References', below .
    
    With the defeat of the Nationalist Coalition government at the 1924 election the coalition disbanded, and its constituent parties operated as independent entities.
    
    The Nationalist Party (Nationalists) was the successor to the Liberal Party which had existed before the First World War, but its support was heavily concentrated in the electoral districts of metropolitan Perth; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 201-204 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and For the political context of this election (1924), see David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see David Black, 'Factionalism and Stability, 1911-1947', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 97-151, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    
    The formation of the United Party meant that members of the Nationalist Party ran as United Party candidates. In this database, then party name Nationalist Party (Nationalists) is used even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    The restructuring of the Country Party contrasted with the weak organization of the Nationalist Party during this period and growing tensions within the party over the secession movement in Western Australia. But this did not prevent the party's success at the 1930 election and its ability to be the dominant partner in the governing coalition; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 204-206, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    The defeat at the 1933 election exacerbated the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In 1931, the federal Parliamentary Labor Party in Canberra split over Depression finance policies, and some members of Labor Party joined with the Nationalist Party to form the United Australia Party under the leadership of Joseph Lyons (see generally, Clem Lloyd, 'The Rise and Fall of the United Australia Party', in J R Nethercote (editor), Liberalism and the Australian Federation pp 113-133, (Sydney: Federation Press, 2001, ISBN 1862874026). The political context of Western Australian politics did not lead to the creation of a WA branch of the United Australia Party; the Nationalist Party retained its name but cooperated with the federal party at federal elections. 
    The defeat at the 1936 election continued the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Independent Nationalist: The only Independent Nationalist candidate was Harry Shearn who won the seat of Maylands at this election without a contest (he had held the seat without any party endorsement since 1936); no party nominated a candidate to run against him at the 1947 election.?
    Women's Electoral League: The votes for this party grouping were all cast for Edith Cowan who ran as a candidate for the League in the electoral district of East Perth. Edith Cowan was the first woman elected to any Australian parliament; she had won the seat of Perth West as a Nationalist Candidate for the Legislative Assembly in 1921, but was defeated (by a rival Nationalist Party candidate) at the 1924 election.

The Australian Democrats fielded candidates for House of Representatives and Senate seats in Western Australia from 1977. This was the first Legislative Assembly election contested by the party in Western Australia; the party fielded 10 candidates at this election (1980).

    Summary details of political parties which have won more than 2 percent of the vote or won a seat at any of the general elections, showing their share of votes and seats, and the various electoral forums in which they have run candidates.
    
    This information and further notes about the Western Australian Legislative Assembly can be found online at The Australian Politics and Elections Database http://elections.uwa.edu.au
    
    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentages first preference vote shares. No swing information is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Liberal Party and Ministerialists
    During the 1890s and early 1900s, factional politics began to give way to political groupings and electoral organizations which foreshadowed the emergence of modern political parties. The term Ministerialists is applied to groupings which, for a variety of reasons, supported a particular government but were not bound by party discipline. By 1911, the emergence of the Labor Party had the effect of polarizing parliamentary politics to that '[v]irtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 223, label the Forrest ministry as 'Protections or Conservative', but the terms reflect the predisposition of the Premier and his supporting group rather than a party organization.
    
    At the 1894 election, the existence of '... a reigning ministry gave [the election] a sharper focus than that of 1890, but it was still predominantly a matter of each candidate running his own campaign with the aid of a local committee. Although Forrest had occasionally called meetings of his supporters in Parliament over the previous four years, there is no evidence to suggest he had any say in the nomination of candidates', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 72.
    
    At the 1876 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Forrest government were more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent' in the table above (see see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 74). Campaigning was undertaken by various trade union groups which would form the basis for the Labor Party at future elections; see generally, H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 341-387, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035); pp 318-321 provide commentary on the 1897 election.
    
    At the 1901 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Throssell government and its policies were becoming more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent', in the table above, although '... many candidates had only the loosest connection with either the Ministerialist or the Opposition group', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 569. The success of candidates affiliated with the labour movement was to hasten the development of modern partisan politics; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    At the 1904 election, politics began to be polarized between Ministerialist candidates, some of whom ran as 'Liberals', and those affiliated with the labour movement; those candidates who ran as Liberals '... were supported by the National Political League formed in March 1904', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570. For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    The 1905 election '... completed the trend towards a two-party Assembly which James [the previous Ministerialist Premier] had encouraged the year before. The Independents all either lost their seats or were driven into the arms of the Ministerialists, who won 35 of the 50 seats .... As was occurring elsewhere in Australia at about the same time, parliamentary politics became permanently established as a conflict between Labor and non-Labor, in preference to other possible patterns', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    By the 1908 election, the success of the Labor Party had had the effect of encouraging the creation of a single non-Labor grouping. 'Although the term 'Liberal Party' did not come into general use until 1911 ... there were two "clearly opposed and fairly evenly balanced political parties" [reference to Hyams, see below]. Virtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor. The degree of non-Labor unity within parliament was not immediately paralleled by the formation of an integrated extra-parliamentary organization ...', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    For a detailed study of non-Labor politics in this period, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354, at pp 346-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035), and note B K Hyams, 'Western Australian Political Parties, 1901-1916', University Studies in History and Economics, [University of Western Australia], 2(3), September 1955: 48-61.
    
    'At the 1911 election, the Ministerialists campaigned for the first time as the Liberal party, bringing them into conformity with the federal party and the [Liberal] League', Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354, at p. 354, (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035). At pp. 346-354 of this essay, de Garis provides a detailed study of non-Labor politics in this period; note also B K Hyams, 'Western Australian Political Parties, 1901-1916', University Studies in History and Economics, [University of Western Australia], 2(3), September 1955: 48-61.
    Liberals for Forests: At the 2001 Election Janet Woollard was elected to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2001, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2001 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2001, ISBN 0730761010), also online at : http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010]). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    
    Labor candidates: 
    
    The 1901 election is the first election for the Legislative Assembly at which candidates were elected who was affiliated to the labour movement. The votes for these candidates are shown as being votes for the Australian Labor Party even though such an organization had not yet been formed. Several bodies competed to represent the labour movement; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p.82); and H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    Candidates affiliated with labour organizations contested 33 electoral districts at the 1904 election and won 22 seats, more than any other party grouping. The party was able to gain enough parliamentary support after the election to replace the James Ministerialist government with a minority Australian Labor Party government; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: p.88; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In the 1905 Election,'Labor was caught ill-prepared and its representation shrank to 15, but the establishment of a clear two-party system of which it was the most sharply defined member, was certainly to its long-term advantage', see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    The split in the Australian Labor Party over the issue of conscription in 1916 had led to a number of its Assembly members defecting to form a National Labor as part of the Nationalist Coalition government which supported conscription; see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, at pp. 369-373, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).

    At the 1921 election, the Australian Labor Party regained some of its electoral support, much of this being at the expense of National Labor Party members who continued to support the Nationalist Coalition government.

    Democratic Labor Party: The Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement suffered major internal divisions in the 1950s which came to a head in 1955 with a split in some state branches of the Party and the creation of what was to become the Democratic Labor Party; for an extensive study of this period, see Robert Murray, The Split: Australian Labor in the Fifties, (Melbourne: Cheshire, 1972, ISBN 0701516755).

    Democratic Party: This party fielded five candidates at this election. It was formed in 1968 and favoured a free enterprise system, opposition to government funding of non-government schools, and a range of other policies; see Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, p.82 (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217) [Jaensch and Mathieson refer to this party as 'Democratic Party (3)' to distinguish it from other parties with the same name].?
    Independents: 'During the term of the Leake ministry (1901 to 1904), the Government and Opposition drew closer together; by the 1904 election the old Forrest 'Conservative' group had become 'Independents' in name', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570.
    
    The Independent member elected at the 1993 election was Elizabeth Constable, who retained the seat of Floreat which she had won in a by-election as an Independent in 1991; Constable viewed herself as an Independent Liberal having originally run for election as the consequence of a factional dispute over candidate endorsement within the Liberal Party.
    
    The three Independents elected at the 1996 election were Ernest Bridge (Kimberley) who had defected from the Australian Labor Party in 1995 after having been the Labor member for Kimberley since 1977; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) who regarded herself as an Independent Liberal since the time of her first entry to the Assembly in a by-election in 1991; and Phillip Pendal (South Perth), who had been elected to the Assembly at the previous election (1993) as a member of the Liberal Party, and sat after this election (1996) as an Independent Liberal.
    
    The vote shown for Independents at this election (2001) is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (54) and those candidates who ran for office without any registered party name (5), a total of 59 such candidates.
    
    Three of the Independent candidates were elected in the 2001 Election, (four if the Liberals for Forests candidate Woolard is included; see Liberals for Forests). Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Phillip Pendal (South Perth) were re-elected as Independents (sitting as Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Larry Graham, who had been denied endorsement by the Labor Party for the seat of Pilbara, ran as an Independent candidate and won the seat.
    
    The vote shown for independents at the 2005 election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (39) and two candidates who ran for office without any registered party name, a total of 41 such candidates.
    
    Two of the Independent candidates were elected; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Janet Woollard (Alfred Cove) were re-elected. Constable sat as an Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Woollard, in spite of being being elected under the banner of the unregistered Liberals for Forests party in 2001, and this party label being registered as a political party in 2005, ran as an Independent at this election (2005); see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2005, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2005 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2006, ISBN 1920886664); also online at: http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010].
    
    The vote shown for independents at the 2008 election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (24) and one candidates who ran for office without any registered party name.

    Liberal Party: For a study of the Liberal Party in the 1911 to 1922 period, see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 195-201 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and note David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    The Liberal Party was also affected by the issue of conscription and the First World War; some of its Assembly members saw themselves as being affiliated with such newly formed Nationalist organizations as the National League, while others campaigned as Liberals who were part of the Nationalist Coalition government; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 197-198 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In this database, former Liberal candidates who campaigned with the support of the National League are referred to as affiliated with the Nationalist Party even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Liberal Party and Liberal and Country League: In 1949, a public meeting '... attended by several hundred people from various parts of the state approved the formation of the Liberal and Country League (LCL) .... The Liberal Party agreed to submerge its identity in the new party...' David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p.218 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Black argues that this change of name was part of a continuing struggle between the Liberal Party and the Country Party; see David Black, 'The Liberals Triumphant: The Politics of Development 1947-1980', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 441-470, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819). 
    Liberals for Forests: Janet Woollard was elected  at the 2001 Election to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Green in 'Sources', below details). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    Country Party: 'The decision of the FSA [Western Australian Farmers and Settlers Association] to form a third political party was taken in 1913 and grew out of the belief among farmers that their interests were neglected by both the existing parties, Labor and Liberal', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 159 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495); for a survey and analysis of the rise of country parties across Australia, see B D Graham, The Formation of the Australian Country Parties, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1966).
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Under Premier Mitchell, the Country Party members became increasingly dissatisfied with the conduct of the Nationalist Coalition government but '... the party had not yet found a formula enabling it to combine its independent identity with its membership of coalition government', Layman, p. 164.
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Some candidates affiliated with the Country Party chose to run without any commitment to the National Coalition government.
    
    Tensions within the Country Party over its role in the National Coalition government of Premier Mitchell led to strains between the Primary Producers Association (PPA) and Country Party members of parliament. In 1923, these disagreements came to a head with the executive of the PPA refusing to endorse several sitting Country Party members. As a consequence, the Party split between those who supported continued close cooperation between Country Party members and the National Coalition (the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party), and those who wished Country Party members to follow a more independent line (the Executive Country Party). Both these groups fielded candidates at this Legislative Assembly election (1924).
    
    For details of this Country Party split, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819), p. 105.
    
    The creation of the United Party meant that there was only one group which claimed the name Country Party for this Legislative Assembly election (1927); on the Country Party during this period, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    The Country Party had suffered a major split in 1923 but had undergone a major reorganization to rebuild its electoral base and parliamentary support in the years leading up to the 1930 election. Its defeat at the 1936 election condemned it to another stint on the opposition benches see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 164-167 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    At the 1944 conference of the Primary Producers Association (PPA), a motion was passed which terminated the administrative arrangements through which the Country Party had been the political wing of the PPA. Its newly acquired political autonomy required the party to create its own organization and source of funds. As part of this reorganization, the party changed its name to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 167-170 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Country Party and Country and Democratic League: The Country Party had changed its name in 1944 to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; the parliamentary party -- but not the organization -- reverted to the name Country Party in 1949. But the party faced strong competition from the Liberals and lost three seats at this election (1950); see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    After the electoral changes of 1947, demographic trends and competition from the Liberals, the Democratic League struggled to maintain its representation; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495.

    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see Lenore Layman, 'Continuity and Change 1947-1965', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 153-183, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    National Alliance and Country Party: In the face of dwindling electoral support and vigorous competition from the Liberal Party, the Country Party merged with the Democratic Labor Party to form the National Alliance '... an unlikely union given the very different social roots and political concerns of the two', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.183 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Not all Country Party parliamentary members joined the new party, and some candidates had joint endorsement for both the Country Party and the National Alliance, three members were elected with National Alliance endorsement (H J Cowan, A V Crane, and W P McPharlin), two with joint endorsement from the Country Party and National Alliance (R C Old and P Jones), and one with endorsement from the Country Party alone (M E Stephens).
    
    The poor performance of the fused party led the Country Party to revert to its previous name and organization after the 1974 election; support for the Democratic Labor Party had collapsed after the election of the Whitlam Australian Labor Party government in Canberra in 1972. 
    National Country Party and Country Party: In response to tensions within the party, and in a further attempt to redefine its role and broaden its electoral appeal, the Country Party changed its name in 1975 to the National Country Party; for context and analysis, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.184 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084)
    A split within the National Country Party in 1978 led to '... the existence of two parties: the larger and more conservative National Country Party (NCP), the Liberals' coalition partner, and the smaller, more radical National Party (NP) playing a cross-bench role. The 1978 split was the culmination of a period of uncertainty as the party tried a number of strategies to arrest electoral decline', Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at p. 109 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084).
    As foreshadowed by Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at pp 116-118 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084) the parties started a process of reunification in 1984 which was completed by 1986 under the name of the National Party of Australia (in this database the name National Party is used for the reunited party to simplify comparisons with other states and to conform to common usage). Not all parliamentary members of the National Country Party accepted the terms for reunion; for brief a comment on the consequences of reuniting the party, see Harry Phillips, 'The Modern Parliament, 1965-1989', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 185-262, at pp 226-246, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839) p. 232.
    
    United Party: The split in the Country Party in 1923 led to the existence of two Country parties, the Executive Country Party, and the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party. The Majority Country Party, '... after an unsuccessful attempt to form their own Independent Country Party, joined with the National League [Nationalist Party] and the remnants of the National Labor Party to form the United Party', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 202 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). At the election, individual candidates campaigning under the banner of the United Party maintained their links to Nationalist or Country Party organizations.?
    Nationalist Coalition The realignment of parties in 1916-1917 led to the creation of a Nationalist Coalition comprising all non-Labor groupings .The Nationalist Coalition had features of both a coalition and a political party and is treated as a single partisan affiliation for the governments of Western Australia between 1917 and 1924. The component groupings maintained their separate identities and became increasingly autonomous after 1917.
    
    The Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Coalition government had been formed as part of the realignment political support that had been prompted by the conscription crisis and the First World War. The Nationalist Party had absorbed most of the support of the Liberal Party but had only a fragmented organization and its relationship with the Liberal League was unclear. Members elected as Nationalists were dominant in the Nationalist Coalition government of Mitchell  (1921 to 1924); see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 98 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and see 'References', below .
    
    With the defeat of the Nationalist Coalition government at the 1924 election the coalition disbanded, and its constituent parties operated as independent entities.
    
    The Nationalist Party (Nationalists) was the successor to the Liberal Party which had existed before the First World War, but its support was heavily concentrated in the electoral districts of metropolitan Perth; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 201-204 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and For the political context of this election (1924), see David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see David Black, 'Factionalism and Stability, 1911-1947', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 97-151, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    
    The formation of the United Party meant that members of the Nationalist Party ran as United Party candidates. In this database, then party name Nationalist Party (Nationalists) is used even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    The restructuring of the Country Party contrasted with the weak organization of the Nationalist Party during this period and growing tensions within the party over the secession movement in Western Australia. But this did not prevent the party's success at the 1930 election and its ability to be the dominant partner in the governing coalition; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 204-206, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    The defeat at the 1933 election exacerbated the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In 1931, the federal Parliamentary Labor Party in Canberra split over Depression finance policies, and some members of Labor Party joined with the Nationalist Party to form the United Australia Party under the leadership of Joseph Lyons (see generally, Clem Lloyd, 'The Rise and Fall of the United Australia Party', in J R Nethercote (editor), Liberalism and the Australian Federation pp 113-133, (Sydney: Federation Press, 2001, ISBN 1862874026). The political context of Western Australian politics did not lead to the creation of a WA branch of the United Australia Party; the Nationalist Party retained its name but cooperated with the federal party at federal elections. 
    The defeat at the 1936 election continued the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Independent Nationalist: The only Independent Nationalist candidate was Harry Shearn who won the seat of Maylands at this election without a contest (he had held the seat without any party endorsement since 1936); no party nominated a candidate to run against him at the 1947 election.?
    Women's Electoral League: The votes for this party grouping were all cast for Edith Cowan who ran as a candidate for the League in the electoral district of East Perth. Edith Cowan was the first woman elected to any Australian parliament; she had won the seat of Perth West as a Nationalist Candidate for the Legislative Assembly in 1921, but was defeated (by a rival Nationalist Party candidate) at the 1924 election.

The votes shown for Social Credit at the 1933 election were cast for a single candidate, E H White, who contested the seat of Perth North as a 'Single Tax' candidate; see Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, Voting for the South Australian, Western Australian and Tasmanian Lower Houses 1890-1964, (Canberra: Department of Political Science, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, 1976, ISBN 0708113346).
    Australia Party: This party emerged as a group to reform the federal Liberal Party in 1966; while its primary focus was on national politics, it fielded candidates at various state elections in all mainland states between 1971 and 1979; see Keith Richmond, 'Minor Parties in Australia', in Graeme Starr, Keith Richmond and Graham Maddox (editors), Political Parties in Australia, pp 317-384, at 344-351, and note Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, pp 32-33, (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217). The party fielded 6 candidates at this Assembly election (1974).
    Progress Party: This party was committed to greatly reduced state intervention in social and economic affairs; see Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, p.146 (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217). The party fielded 5 candidates at this election (1977) and 3 candidates at this election (1980).
    
    Australian Democrats: The Australian Democrats emerged as a centre party immediately preceding the 1977 federal election to capture the support of voters who were dissatisfied with both the Labor and Liberal parties; see John Warhurst (editor), Keeping the Bastards Honest: The Australian Democrats' First Twenty Years, (St. Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1997, ISBN 1864484209). The Australian Democrats fielded candidates for House of Representatives and Senate seats in Western Australia from 1977. This was the first Legislative Assembly election contested by the party in Western Australia; the party fielded 10 candidates at this election (1980).

    Summary details of political parties which have won more than 2 percent of the vote or won a seat at any of the general elections, showing their share of votes and seats, and the various electoral forums in which they have run candidates.
    
    This information and further notes about the Western Australian Legislative Assembly can be found online at The Australian Politics and Elections Database http://elections.uwa.edu.au
    
    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentages first preference vote shares. No swing information is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Liberal Party and Ministerialists
    During the 1890s and early 1900s, factional politics began to give way to political groupings and electoral organizations which foreshadowed the emergence of modern political parties. The term Ministerialists is applied to groupings which, for a variety of reasons, supported a particular government but were not bound by party discipline. By 1911, the emergence of the Labor Party had the effect of polarizing parliamentary politics to that '[v]irtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 223, label the Forrest ministry as 'Protections or Conservative', but the terms reflect the predisposition of the Premier and his supporting group rather than a party organization.
    
    At the 1894 election, the existence of '... a reigning ministry gave [the election] a sharper focus than that of 1890, but it was still predominantly a matter of each candidate running his own campaign with the aid of a local committee. Although Forrest had occasionally called meetings of his supporters in Parliament over the previous four years, there is no evidence to suggest he had any say in the nomination of candidates', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 72.
    
    At the 1876 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Forrest government were more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent' in the table above (see see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 74). Campaigning was undertaken by various trade union groups which would form the basis for the Labor Party at future elections; see generally, H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 341-387, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035); pp 318-321 provide commentary on the 1897 election.
    
    At the 1901 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Throssell government and its policies were becoming more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent', in the table above, although '... many candidates had only the loosest connection with either the Ministerialist or the Opposition group', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 569. The success of candidates affiliated with the labour movement was to hasten the development of modern partisan politics; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    At the 1904 election, politics began to be polarized between Ministerialist candidates, some of whom ran as 'Liberals', and those affiliated with the labour movement; those candidates who ran as Liberals '... were supported by the National Political League formed in March 1904', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570.

    The 1905 election '... completed the trend towards a two-party Assembly which James [the previous Ministerialist Premier] had encouraged the year before. The Independents all either lost their seats or were driven into the arms of the Ministerialists, who won 35 of the 50 seats .... As was occurring elsewhere in Australia at about the same time, parliamentary politics became permanently established as a conflict between Labor and non-Labor, in preference to other possible patterns', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    By the 1908 election, the success of the Labor Party had had the effect of encouraging the creation of a single non-Labor grouping. 'Although the term 'Liberal Party' did not come into general use until 1911 ... there were two "clearly opposed and fairly evenly balanced political parties" [reference to Hyams, see below]. Virtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor. The degree of non-Labor unity within parliament was not immediately paralleled by the formation of an integrated extra-parliamentary organization ...', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Liberals for Forests: At the 2001 Election Janet Woollard was elected to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2001, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2001 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2001, ISBN 0730761010), also online at : http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010]).

    Labor candidates: 
    
    The 1901 election is the first election for the Legislative Assembly at which candidates were elected who was affiliated to the labour movement. The votes for these candidates are shown as being votes for the Australian Labor Party even though such an organization had not yet been formed. Several bodies competed to represent the labour movement; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p.82); and H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    Candidates affiliated with labour organizations contested 33 electoral districts at the 1904 election and won 22 seats, more than any other party grouping. The party was able to gain enough parliamentary support after the election to replace the James Ministerialist government with a minority Australian Labor Party government; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: p.88; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In the 1905 Election,'Labor was caught ill-prepared and its representation shrank to 15, but the establishment of a clear two-party system of which it was the most sharply defined member, was certainly to its long-term advantage', see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    The split in the Australian Labor Party over the issue of conscription in 1916 had led to a number of its Assembly members defecting to form a National Labor as part of the Nationalist Coalition government which supported conscription; see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, at pp. 369-373, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).

    At the 1921 election, the Australian Labor Party regained some of its electoral support, much of this being at the expense of National Labor Party members who continued to support the Nationalist Coalition government.

    Democratic Labor Party: The Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement suffered major internal divisions in the 1950s which came to a head in 1955 with a split in some state branches of the Party and the creation of what was to become the Democratic Labor Party; for an extensive study of this period, see Robert Murray, The Split: Australian Labor in the Fifties, (Melbourne: Cheshire, 1972, ISBN 0701516755).

    Democratic Party: This party fielded five candidates at this election. It was formed in 1968 and favoured a free enterprise system, opposition to government funding of non-government schools, and a range of other policies; see Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, p.82 (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217) [Jaensch and Mathieson refer to this party as 'Democratic Party (3)' to distinguish it from other parties with the same name].?
    Independents: 'During the term of the Leake ministry (1901 to 1904), the Government and Opposition drew closer together; by the 1904 election the old Forrest 'Conservative' group had become 'Independents' in name', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570.
    
    The Independent member elected at the 1993 election was Elizabeth Constable, who retained the seat of Floreat which she had won in a by-election as an Independent in 1991; Constable viewed herself as an Independent Liberal having originally run for election as the consequence of a factional dispute over candidate endorsement within the Liberal Party.
    
    The three Independents elected at the 1996 election were Ernest Bridge (Kimberley) who had defected from the Australian Labor Party in 1995 after having been the Labor member for Kimberley since 1977; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) who regarded herself as an Independent Liberal since the time of her first entry to the Assembly in a by-election in 1991; and Phillip Pendal (South Perth), who had been elected to the Assembly at the previous election (1993) as a member of the Liberal Party, and sat after this election (1996) as an Independent Liberal.
    
    The vote shown for Independents at this election (2001) is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (54) and those candidates who ran for office without any registered party name (5), a total of 59 such candidates.
    
    Three of the Independent candidates were elected in the 2001 Election, (four if the Liberals for Forests candidate Woolard is included; see Liberals for Forests). Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Phillip Pendal (South Perth) were re-elected as Independents (sitting as Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Larry Graham, who had been denied endorsement by the Labor Party for the seat of Pilbara, ran as an Independent candidate and won the seat.
    
    The vote shown for independents at the 2005 election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (39) and two candidates who ran for office without any registered party name, a total of 41 such candidates.
    
    Two of the Independent candidates were elected; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Janet Woollard (Alfred Cove) were re-elected. Constable sat as an Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Woollard, in spite of being being elected under the banner of the unregistered Liberals for Forests party in 2001, and this party label being registered as a political party in 2005, ran as an Independent at this election (2005); see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2005, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2005 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2006, ISBN 1920886664); also online at: http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010].

    The Liberal Party was also affected by the issue of conscription and the First World War; some of its Assembly members saw themselves as being affiliated with such newly formed Nationalist organizations as the National League, while others campaigned as Liberals who were part of the Nationalist Coalition government; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 197-198 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In this database, former Liberal candidates who campaigned with the support of the National League are referred to as affiliated with the Nationalist Party even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Liberal Party and Liberal and Country League: In 1949, a public meeting '... attended by several hundred people from various parts of the state approved the formation of the Liberal and Country League (LCL) .... The Liberal Party agreed to submerge its identity in the new party...' David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p.218 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Black argues that this change of name was part of a continuing struggle between the Liberal Party and the Country Party; see David Black, 'The Liberals Triumphant: The Politics of Development 1947-1980', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 441-470, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819). 
    Liberals for Forests: Janet Woollard was elected  at the 2001 Election to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Green in 'Sources', below details). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    Country Party: 'The decision of the FSA [Western Australian Farmers and Settlers Association] to form a third political party was taken in 1913 and grew out of the belief among farmers that their interests were neglected by both the existing parties, Labor and Liberal', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 159 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495); for a survey and analysis of the rise of country parties across Australia, see B D Graham, The Formation of the Australian Country Parties, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1966).
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Under Premier Mitchell, the Country Party members became increasingly dissatisfied with the conduct of the Nationalist Coalition government but '... the party had not yet found a formula enabling it to combine its independent identity with its membership of coalition government', Layman, p. 164.
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Some candidates affiliated with the Country Party chose to run without any commitment to the National Coalition government.
    
    Tensions within the Country Party over its role in the National Coalition government of Premier Mitchell led to strains between the Primary Producers Association (PPA) and Country Party members of parliament. In 1923, these disagreements came to a head with the executive of the PPA refusing to endorse several sitting Country Party members. As a consequence, the Party split between those who supported continued close cooperation between Country Party members and the National Coalition (the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party), and those who wished Country Party members to follow a more independent line (the Executive Country Party). Both these groups fielded candidates at this Legislative Assembly election (1924).
    
    For details of this Country Party split, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819), p. 105.
    
    The creation of the United Party meant that there was only one group which claimed the name Country Party for this Legislative Assembly election (1927); on the Country Party during this period, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    The Country Party had suffered a major split in 1923 but had undergone a major reorganization to rebuild its electoral base and parliamentary support in the years leading up to the 1930 election. Its defeat at the 1936 election condemned it to another stint on the opposition benches see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 164-167 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    At the 1944 conference of the Primary Producers Association (PPA), a motion was passed which terminated the administrative arrangements through which the Country Party had been the political wing of the PPA. Its newly acquired political autonomy required the party to create its own organization and source of funds. As part of this reorganization, the party changed its name to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 167-170 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Country Party and Country and Democratic League: The Country Party had changed its name in 1944 to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; the parliamentary party -- but not the organization -- reverted to the name Country Party in 1949. But the party faced strong competition from the Liberals and lost three seats at this election (1950); see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    After the electoral changes of 1947, demographic trends and competition from the Liberals, the Democratic League struggled to maintain its representation; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495.

    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see Lenore Layman, 'Continuity and Change 1947-1965', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 153-183, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    National Alliance and Country Party: In the face of dwindling electoral support and vigorous competition from the Liberal Party, the Country Party merged with the Democratic Labor Party to form the National Alliance '... an unlikely union given the very different social roots and political concerns of the two', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.183 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Not all Country Party parliamentary members joined the new party, and some candidates had joint endorsement for both the Country Party and the National Alliance, three members were elected with National Alliance endorsement (H J Cowan, A V Crane, and W P McPharlin), two with joint endorsement from the Country Party and National Alliance (R C Old and P Jones), and one with endorsement from the Country Party alone (M E Stephens).
    
    The poor performance of the fused party led the Country Party to revert to its previous name and organization after the 1974 election; support for the Democratic Labor Party had collapsed after the election of the Whitlam Australian Labor Party government in Canberra in 1972. 
    National Country Party and Country Party: In response to tensions within the party, and in a further attempt to redefine its role and broaden its electoral appeal, the Country Party changed its name in 1975 to the National Country Party; for context and analysis, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.184 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084)
    A split within the National Country Party in 1978 led to '... the existence of two parties: the larger and more conservative National Country Party (NCP), the Liberals' coalition partner, and the smaller, more radical National Party (NP) playing a cross-bench role. The 1978 split was the culmination of a period of uncertainty as the party tried a number of strategies to arrest electoral decline', Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at p. 109 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084).
    As foreshadowed by Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at pp 116-118 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084) the parties started a process of reunification in 1984 which was completed by 1986 under the name of the National Party of Australia (in this database the name National Party is used for the reunited party to simplify comparisons with other states and to conform to common usage). Not all parliamentary members of the National Country Party accepted the terms for reunion; for brief a comment on the consequences of reuniting the party, see Harry Phillips, 'The Modern Parliament, 1965-1989', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 185-262, at pp 226-246, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839) p. 232.
    
    United Party: The split in the Country Party in 1923 led to the existence of two Country parties, the Executive Country Party, and the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party. The Majority Country Party, '... after an unsuccessful attempt to form their own Independent Country Party, joined with the National League [Nationalist Party] and the remnants of the National Labor Party to form the United Party', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 202 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). At the election, individual candidates campaigning under the banner of the United Party maintained their links to Nationalist or Country Party organizations.?
    Nationalist Coalition The realignment of parties in 1916-1917 led to the creation of a Nationalist Coalition comprising all non-Labor groupings .The Nationalist Coalition had features of both a coalition and a political party and is treated as a single partisan affiliation for the governments of Western Australia between 1917 and 1924. The component groupings maintained their separate identities and became increasingly autonomous after 1917.
    
    The Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Coalition government had been formed as part of the realignment political support that had been prompted by the conscription crisis and the First World War. The Nationalist Party had absorbed most of the support of the Liberal Party but had only a fragmented organization and its relationship with the Liberal League was unclear. Members elected as Nationalists were dominant in the Nationalist Coalition government of Mitchell  (1921 to 1924); see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 98 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and see 'References', below .
    
    With the defeat of the Nationalist Coalition government at the 1924 election the coalition disbanded, and its constituent parties operated as independent entities.
    
    The Nationalist Party (Nationalists) was the successor to the Liberal Party which had existed before the First World War, but its support was heavily concentrated in the electoral districts of metropolitan Perth; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 201-204 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and For the political context of this election (1924), see David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see David Black, 'Factionalism and Stability, 1911-1947', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 97-151, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    
    The formation of the United Party meant that members of the Nationalist Party ran as United Party candidates. In this database, then party name Nationalist Party (Nationalists) is used even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    The restructuring of the Country Party contrasted with the weak organization of the Nationalist Party during this period and growing tensions within the party over the secession movement in Western Australia. But this did not prevent the party's success at the 1930 election and its ability to be the dominant partner in the governing coalition; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 204-206, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    The defeat at the 1933 election exacerbated the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In 1931, the federal Parliamentary Labor Party in Canberra split over Depression finance policies, and some members of Labor Party joined with the Nationalist Party to form the United Australia Party under the leadership of Joseph Lyons (see generally, Clem Lloyd, 'The Rise and Fall of the United Australia Party', in J R Nethercote (editor), Liberalism and the Australian Federation pp 113-133, (Sydney: Federation Press, 2001, ISBN 1862874026). The political context of Western Australian politics did not lead to the creation of a WA branch of the United Australia Party; the Nationalist Party retained its name but cooperated with the federal party at federal elections. 
    The defeat at the 1936 election continued the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Independent Nationalist: The only Independent Nationalist candidate was Harry Shearn who won the seat of Maylands at this election without a contest (he had held the seat without any party endorsement since 1936); no party nominated a candidate to run against him at the 1947 election.?
    Women's Electoral League: The votes for this party grouping were all cast for Edith Cowan who ran as a candidate for the League in the electoral district of East Perth. Edith Cowan was the first woman elected to any Australian parliament; she had won the seat of Perth West as a Nationalist Candidate for the Legislative Assembly in 1921, but was defeated (by a rival Nationalist Party candidate) at the 1924 election.

The Australian Democrats fielded candidates for House of Representatives and Senate seats in Western Australia from 1977. This was the first Legislative Assembly election contested by the party in Western Australia; the party fielded 10 candidates at this election (1980).

    weighting criteria
    
    With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each metropolitan Statistical Division and in each "rest of State" area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspaper Releases and Computer Sheets.
    
    Whilst the survey is conducted only in private dwellings, it is assumed that people living in non-private dwellings such as boarding houses, hospitals, hotels and motels have similar characteristics to those living in private dwellings.
    
    weighting procedures
    
    The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.

    multi-stage cluster sample with age and sex quota
    
    The survey is conducted on the first two weekends of the month.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of 150 small clusters of households throughout the six states and the ACT.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.
    
    The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to 124 Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electorates.
    
    At the next stage of the design, within each Electorate, a number of Electoral Sub-Divisions is chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to latest electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.
    
    Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector's district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.
    
    At the final stage, within each selected collector's district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous Monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is ten effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and five effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.
    
    Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 16 and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.
    
    All types of dwellings are called on and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases, the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called on in its place.

    Data on households covered household composition, including sex of head of household, visitors, duration of residence, location of dwelling, type of dwelling, land ownership, rent and payments, details of type of construction, facilities, utilities, furnishings and appliances, consumer durables and books/musical instruments, interior and exterior care and maintenance and whether dwellings condemned.
    
    Data on individuals included housing, age, sex, marital status, race,
    relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
    whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
    education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
     
    Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.
    
    Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.

    The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.
    
    In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.

    This study is the eighth in a series of national household surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-2001. The seven earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. For the 'Drop & collect' sample, a sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. For the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) sample these sections were asked directly by the interviewer.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/ analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, cannabis, heroin, methadone, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy, GHB, ketamines and inhalants.
    
    Background variables include state, remoteness category, sex, age, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and index of socio-economic disadvantage, and household descriptions.

    The Australian Everyday Consumption project represents the first ever study of Australians' cultural consumption. The study aims to delineate the cultural activities of Australians and their relationship to social class. The survey covers a broad range of cultural pursuits, and variables include the books, newspapers and magazines people read; the film and television programs they watch; the types of cars they drive and possession of other consumer durables; their musical interests; the suburbs they live in; their homes and levels of home ownership; whether they gamble; their hobbies; whether they play and/or watch sport; membership of clubs; what they eat; their pets; how often they attend galleries, concerts and/or the theatre; the clothes they wear; their families and friends; working conditions and working hours; comparisons with spouse and parents; personal and household financial details; religious beliefs and practices; and their attitudes towards societal classes, culture, politics and government, finance and the economy, trade unions, gender and employment, and Aboriginal land rights.
    
    Background variables include respondent's age, sex, marital status, level of education, country of birth, work status, income and occupation.

    The Australian Everyday Consumption project represents the first ever study of Australians' cultural consumption. The study aims to delineate the cultural activities of Australians and their relationship to social class. The survey covers a broad range of cultural pursuits, and variables include the books, newspapers and magazines people read; the film and television programs they watch; the types of cars they drive and possession of other consumer durables; their musical interests; the suburbs they live in; their homes and levels of home ownership; whether they gamble; their hobbies; whether they play and/or watch sport; membership of clubs; what they eat; their pets; how often they attend galleries, concerts and/or the theatre; the clothes they wear; their families and friends; working conditions and working hours; comparisons with spouse and parents; personal and household financial details; religious beliefs and practices; and their attitudes towards societal classes, culture, politics and government, finance and the economy, trade unions, gender and employment, and Aboriginal land rights.
    
    Background variables include respondent's age, sex, marital status, level of education, country of birth, work status, income and occupation.

    The Australian Values Study was undertaken as part of a major international survey to compare fundamental values in different countries throughout the world. It focuses on such areas as attitudes towards work, life satisfaction, family, political, moral, religious and spiritual values, and a wide range of social issues. The study was conducted in two parts. The first stage was a personal interview questionnaire, administered by an interviewer. The data for this stage has been previously documented as 'Australian Values Study Survey, 1983' (SSDA Study No. 375). The second stage was a questionnaire left by the interviewer, to be completed by the respondent and mailed back.
    
    Topics covered in the mail-back questionnaire include newspaper and magazine readership; television watching and radio listening; parental attitudes; family costs; division of labour in the household; personal experiences in the previous year; opinions on current social issues such as invitro fertilisation, nuclear arms, terrorism, conditions for aborigines in Australia; views on economic development and growth in Australia, government intervention in business, jobs and trade unions; perceptions of individual companies, changes in the respondent's own attitudes and opinions; details of food and beverages usually consumed, types of cigarettes and cigars smoked; personal finance, investment and credit card usage; insurance and superannuation; and makes and models of automobiles purchased or preferred. Background variables include age, sex, birthplace, nationality, languages, level of education, employment status, approximate income, occupation, details of main income earner, household pets, home ownership, type of dwelling and size of town.

    The Australian Values Study was undertaken as part of a major international survey to compare fundamental values in different countries throughout the world. It focuses on such areas as attitudes towards work, life satisfaction, family, political, moral, religious and spiritual values, and a wide range of social issues. The study was conducted in two parts. The first stage was a personal interview questionnaire, administered by an interviewer. The data for this stage has been previously documented as 'Australian Values Study Survey, 1983' (SSDA Study No. 375). The second stage was a questionnaire left by the interviewer, to be completed by the respondent and mailed back.
    
    Topics covered in the mail-back questionnaire include newspaper and magazine readership; television watching and radio listening; parental attitudes; family costs; division of labour in the household; personal experiences in the previous year; opinions on current social issues such as invitro fertilisation, nuclear arms, terrorism, conditions for aborigines in Australia; views on economic development and growth in Australia, government intervention in business, jobs and trade unions; perceptions of individual companies, changes in the respondent's own attitudes and opinions; details of food and beverages usually consumed, types of cigarettes and cigars smoked; personal finance, investment and credit card usage; insurance and superannuation; and makes and models of automobiles purchased or preferred. Background variables include age, sex, birthplace, nationality, languages, level of education, employment status, approximate income, occupation, details of main income earner, household pets, home ownership, type of dwelling and size of town.

    The Australian Values Study used a probability sample of approximately 1,200 Australians in both country and city areas.
    
    Interviews were conducted within each of 110 electoral sub-divisions chosen at random within 13 strata based upon the six states and the two territories, split into urban and rural categories.  Within each of these subdivisions, one elector's name was selected at random.  The residence adjoining this elector's was the first contact dwelling, and further adjoining dwellings were approached until the quota of ten interviews was filled.
    
    People were selected at each dwelling for interviewing by a method which produces accurate cross-sections of each sex and age.  The smaller states, Tasmania and South Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory were over-sampled to make interstate comparisons possible.

    The National Centre of the Cervix Screening Policy was developed following a report made by the Cervical Cancer Screening Evaluation Steering Committee of the Australian Health Minister's Advisory Council.  The evaluation called for an organised approach to screening for cancer of the cervix based on an agreed national policy.  The resulting policy states that all asymptomatic women aged 18-70 who are, or who have ever been, sexually active should have biennial Pap Smears.
    
    The Cancer of the Cervix campaign was developed as a strategy to communicate the aims of this policy to Australian women.  National pre and post-campaign surveys were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign in providing women with information about the policy, specifically information regarding Pap Smears and the need for biennial screening.
    
    Respondents were asked whether they had heard of Pap Smear tests; if they had observed any advertising and/or other information on Pap Smears; what they thought the tests were used to detect; the plausibility of reasons for not having Pap Smears; their own reason for not having a Pap Smear; how often they had had Pap Smears in the past and how often they propose to have them in the future; the age and reason when Pap Smears are no longer needed; and whether they had had an abnormal Pap Smear result.
    
    Background variables include age, whether the respondent is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent; whether English is the main language spoken in the household; marital status; highest level of education; occupation; annual income; and occupation and annual income of the main income earner.

    The National Centre of the Cervix Screening Policy was developed following a report made by the Cervical Cancer Screening Evaluation Steering Committee of the Australian Health Minister's Advisory Council.  The evaluation called for an organised approach to screening for cancer of the cervix based on an agreed national policy.  The resulting policy states that all asymptomatic women aged 18-70 who are, or who have ever been, sexually active should have biennial Pap Smears.
    
    The Cancer of the Cervix campaign was developed as a strategy to communicate the aims of this policy to Australian women.  National pre and post-campaign surveys were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign in providing women with information about the policy, specifically information regarding Pap Smears and the need for biennial screening.
    
    Respondents were asked whether they had heard of Pap Smear tests; if they had observed any advertising and/or other information on Pap Smears; what they thought the tests were used to detect; the plausibility of reasons for not having Pap Smears; their own reason for not having a Pap Smear; how often they had had Pap Smears in the past and how often they propose to have them in the future; the age and reason when Pap Smears are no longer needed; and whether they had had an abnormal Pap Smear result.
    
    Background variables include age, whether the respondent is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent; whether English is the main language spoken in the household; marital status; highest level of education; occupation; annual income; and occupation and annual income of the main income earner.

    In 1985 a study of drug use patterns and attitudes amongst secondary school students was conducted by the Health Department of Victoria. The objectives of the study were to identify the current alcohol and drug use patterns of Victorian secondary school students and to look at the relationship between substance use and a number of social and personal indicators. The results were used to assist in determining the appropriate delivery of existing intervention programs and for the development and targeting of future programs. This study was repeated in 1989 and 1992 to identify changes over time, if any, in patterns of usage and attitudes, thus helping to evaluate the effectiveness of established drug programs.
    
    Students were asked about their use of the following drugs - steroids, inhalants, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy, and in particular, cigarettes/tobacco, alcohol, pain killers, tranquillisers, and marijuana. Questions included at what age the respondent first tried the drug, how often they used the drug, the source of the drug and what effect the drug had on them. Opinions on the use of drugs (e.g. how dangerous they believed use of a particular drug was) were also sought as was the source of their information on drugs and their effects.
    
    Background variables included sex, age, place of birth, the year level at school the respondent was currently in, whether the respondent was an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and if more than one language was spoken at home.

    In 1985 a study of drug use patterns and attitudes amongst secondary school students was conducted by the Health Department of Victoria. The objectives of the study were to identify the current alcohol and drug use patterns of Victorian secondary school students and to look at the relationship between substance use and a number of social and personal indicators. The results were used to assist in determining the appropriate delivery of existing intervention programs and for the development and targeting of future programs. This study was repeated in 1989 and 1992 to identify changes over time, if any, in patterns of usage and attitudes, thus helping to evaluate the effectiveness of established drug programs.
    
    Students were asked about their use of the following drugs - steroids, inhalants, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy, and in particular, cigarettes/tobacco, alcohol, pain killers, tranquillisers, and marijuana. Questions included at what age the respondent first tried the drug, how often they used the drug, the source of the drug and what effect the drug had on them. Opinions on the use of drugs (e.g. how dangerous they believed use of a particular drug was) were also sought as was the source of their information on drugs and their effects.
    
    Background variables included sex, age, place of birth, the year level at school the respondent was currently in, whether the respondent was an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and if more than one language was spoken at home.

    stratified random sample 
    
    The sampling frame for the selection of schools was based on data from the 1991 ABS School Census.
    
    The schools were stratified into three school systems - Government, Catholic and Independent. Each Government school was then stratified into a broad geographic identifier: metropolitan, non-metropolitan urban and non-metropolitan rural. This step was necessary to accomodate the Department's desire to over-sample Goverment non-metropolitan rural schools.
    
    Each Catholic or Independent school was stratified into either metropolitan or non-metropolitan.
    
    A further level of stratification was undertaken to ensure representativeness across education regions. Schools were selected from all three systems for the metropolitan regions: Eastern, Southern and Western. Government and Catholic schools were selected from the five non-metropolitan regions. Because of the small number of non-metropolitan independent schools no regional stratification was undertaken.
    
    This gave a total of twenty five strata: thirteen Government, eight Catholic and four Independent.  Schools for each of the twenty five strata were selected such that the probability of a school being chosen was proportional to its enrolment.

    In light of the current drug policy which acts to deter drug use through law enforcement, the study was undertaken to investigate whether the threat of legal punishment has any influence on marijuana use by high school aged students.  Using a proven theoretical model, influence was measured both in terms of direct deterrence (e.g. through perceptions of arrest risk and fear of punishment) and indirect deterrence (e.g. physical and material cost of complying or not complying with the law; moral commitment to the law; and informal sanctions imposed by peers, family, or other significant members of the potential user's social network).  Emphasis,however, was placed on the former  in order to evaluate the effectiveness  of law enforcement on drug use and hence its worth as a method of drug control.
    
    Respondents were asked questions on their use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, pain relievers, sedatives, narcotics (e.g. heroin) and other recreational drugs (e.g. stimulants, hallucinogens);  the number of times they  and/or members of their family had been caught for marijuana possession; the consequences of that arrest;  ease, and financial cost, of obtaining marijuana;  their perceived risk of being caught for marijuana possession and/or use; their personal view of those who use marijuana and the health risks associated with usage; and the effect the opinions of others has on their own use of marijuana. 
    
    Background variables include age, sex, parents country of birth, language spoken at home, household composition, and whether the respodent is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.

    A specialised randomly selected sample was taken from the 1992 Survey of Drug Use by NSW Secondary School Students whose sampling procedure was as follows: area-cluster sample; stratified random sample 
    
    The target sample size of students was stratified by school system (government and non-government) and health region. Within each stratum schools were randomly selected with a probability proportional to the size of their enrolment. This meant that larger schools had a greater chance of being selected. The lists of schools enrolled by health region and school system (government and non-government) were provided by the NSW Department of School Education.
    
    The selected schools were approached for their cooperation and those agreeing to participate were asked to select, at random, one class from each of Years 7-11 and where possible, not to select classes that were based on a particular subject or ability level.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

  value: "A national survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services (Byrne, Garwood, Moorcroft, and Barnes, 1995) in Australian libraries, followed by case studies in a select number of libraries. \n\n\
    This project concerns a series of good practice protocols by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network (ATSILIRN) in 1995. The Protocols were developed to guide libraries, archives, and information services to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities which the organisations serve, and\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Handle materials with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content.\n\n\
    A literature search indicates that a number of organisations (both LIS and non-LIS based) refer to the protocols but there is no evidence of any research conducted into the relevance and application of the protocols at an institutional level.\n\n\
    A research team at the University of Technology Sydney, endorsed by ATSILIRN, conducted a study into the practical implementation of the protocols across Australia. All relevant library, archive and information service institutions were invited to take part in a national survey. The researchers will follow this up with a study of innovative or exemplary practices to further assist institutions in applying the protocols.\n\n\
    It is anticipated that the research will be used to compile a number of reports covering but not limited to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Relevance of the protocols at local, regional and national institutions\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Issues and concerns of institutions relating to Indigenous issues.\n\n\
    Papers are also planned for national and international conferences with the aim of enlisting support for a consistent approach to Indigenous materials held in libraries, archives and information services."

  value: "A national survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services (Byrne, Garwood, Moorcroft, and Barnes, 1995) in Australian libraries, followed by case studies in a select number of libraries. \n\n\
    This project concerns a series of good practice protocols by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network (ATSILIRN) in 1995. The Protocols were developed to guide libraries, archives, and information services to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities which the organisations serve, and\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Handle materials with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content.\n\n\
    A literature search indicates that a number of organisations (both LIS and non-LIS based) refer to the protocols but there is no evidence of any research conducted into the relevance and application of the protocols at an institutional level.\n\n\
    A research team at the University of Technology Sydney, endorsed by ATSILIRN, conducted a study into the practical implementation of the protocols across Australia. All relevant library, archive and information service institutions were invited to take part in a national survey. The researchers will follow this up with a study of innovative or exemplary practices to further assist institutions in applying the protocols.\n\n\
    It is anticipated that the research will be used to compile a number of reports covering but not limited to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Relevance of the protocols at local, regional and national institutions\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Issues and concerns of institutions relating to Indigenous issues.\n\n\
    Papers are also planned for national and international conferences with the aim of enlisting support for a consistent approach to Indigenous materials held in libraries, archives and information services."

    This study is one element in the ACT Drug Indicators Project which aims to produce a system to attempt to estimate the incidence, prevalence and character of illegal drug use in the ACT area and to monitor relative changes in drug use levels and patterns over time. 
    
    Two different questionnaires were used to obtain data, one filled in by participating drug treatment agencies on each new admission (1729) and the other filled in by police on each drug arrest (774). The drug treatment and welfare agencies were able to obtain more detailed information on drug use and drug treatment while the police were able to obtain more detailed information on current and prior criminal charges.
    
    The main variables from the police questionnaire included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; prior criminal record; current criminal charges and drug charge types. The main variables from the drug agencies included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; mode of drug use; frequency of use;  referral source and previous drug treatment. 
    
    Background variables included: sex, residential area, marital status, age, country of birth, Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal, accommodation type, employment status, number of children under 18 and number of children under 18 living with the client.

    This study is one element in the ACT Drug Indicators Project which aims to produce a system to attempt to estimate the incidence, prevalence and character of illegal drug use in the ACT area and to monitor relative changes in drug use levels and patterns over time. 
    
    Two different questionnaires were used to obtain data, one filled in by participating drug treatment agencies on each new admission (1729) and the other filled in by police on each drug arrest (774). The drug treatment and welfare agencies were able to obtain more detailed information on drug use and drug treatment while the police were able to obtain more detailed information on current and prior criminal charges.
    
    The main variables from the police questionnaire included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; prior criminal record; current criminal charges and drug charge types. The main variables from the drug agencies included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; mode of drug use; frequency of use;  referral source and previous drug treatment. 
    
    Background variables included: sex, residential area, marital status, age, country of birth, Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal, accommodation type, employment status, number of children under 18 and number of children under 18 living with the client.

    This study is the fifth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current attitudes towards drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1995. The four earlier studies were Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; and the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; and supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal population in 1994. This survey is also the first survey in the National Drug Strategy Household Survey series which has followed on from the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey Series.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern about various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. The drugs covered were: alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine/crack, ecstasy/designer drugs, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants (eg. glue, petrol), marijuana/hash, pain killers/analgesics, steroids, tobacco/cigarettes and tranquillisers. Respondents were also asked if they had been victims of physical and/or verbal abuse and property damage and/or theft by someone affected by alcohol or had themselves committed these offences when under the influence. This survey also includes extra questions on health, marijuana attitudes, and co-use of drugs.
    
    Background variables included geographical location, sex, age group, birthplace, employment status and occupation of self and spouse, education status, and the number and ages of other people in the household.

  value: A two-stage weighting process was undertaken in order to calculate person specific weights. The first stage involved calculating the probablitiy of the selection of the person within the household, to account for the higer possibility of selecting certain persons from smaller households. The second stage involved an age/sex expansion weight to ensure the age/sex estimated benchmarks for each state were achieved according to current population based on the 1991 ABS Census counts.

  value: A two-stage weighting process was undertaken in order to calculate person specific weights. The first stage involved calculating the probablitiy of the selection of the person within the household, to account for the higer possibility of selecting certain persons from smaller households. The second stage involved an age/sex expansion weight to ensure the age/sex estimated benchmarks for each state were achieved according to current population based on the 1991 ABS Census counts.

    This study is the fifth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current attitudes towards drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1995. The four earlier studies were Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; and the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; and supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal population in 1994. This survey is also the first survey in the National Drug Strategy Household Survey series which has followed on from the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey Series.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern about various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. The drugs covered were: alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine/crack, ecstasy/designer drugs, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants (eg. glue, petrol), marijuana/hash, pain killers/analgesics, steroids, tobacco/cigarettes and tranquillisers. Respondents were also asked if they had been victims of physical and/or verbal abuse and property damage and/or theft by someone affected by alcohol or had themselves committed these offences when under the influence. This survey also includes extra questions on health, marijuana attitudes, and co-use of drugs.
    
    Background variables included geographical location, sex, age group, birthplace, employment status and occupation of self and spouse, education status, and the number and ages of other people in the household.

    The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Profiles (ACPs) are tabulations giving key census characteristics of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons, families and dwellings, covering most topics on the 1991 Census of Population and Housing form. This profile is presented at the Section of State level. 
    
    The ACP consists of 29 tables which crosstabulate characteristics including gender, age, place of birth, religion, marital status, education, income, occupation and employment status.

    The Australian Election Study is the second in the series initiated in 1987, and builds on the data collected earlier in the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The series provides a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigates the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term perspectives it examines the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result. 
    
    Two major themes are covered in the survey, the economy and the environment. Questions on the economy include retrospective and prospective evaluations of the country's economy and the individual's own personal household situation; wages and price controls; attitudes to particular economic issues; and the position of the major parties and party leaders on the main economic issues. Questions on the environment include attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general; the role of industry and the government in ensuring environmental protection; rankings of the most urgent environmental issues and the respondent's assessment of their likely future importance; and attitudes toward environmental pressure and interest groups, including current or likely membership.  
    
    As in the 1987 AES, a range of questions are included in the survey which cover election issues and the respondent's assessment of the most effective party to handle them, as well as questions on specific political issues such as government spending and the pilots' dispute. A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care and many others. A section on industrial policy focuses on attitudes towards the control of the economy, attitudes to trade unions and big business, and to industrial conflict in general. In addition to the standard questions on vote in the current election, recalled vote in the 1987 federal election, and party identification, the survey contains an extensive section dealing with attitudes to the major parties and to the party leaders. Finally, a range of demographic data are collected for each respondent and their spouse or partner, if applicable.

    The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Profiles (ACPs) are tabulations giving key census characteristics of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons, families and dwellings, covering most topics on the 1991 Census of Population and Housing form. This profile is presented at the Statistical Local Area level. 
    
    The ACP consists of 29 tables which crosstabulate characteristics including gender, age, place of birth, religion, marital status, education, income, occupation and employment status.

    The Australian Election Study is the second in the series initiated in 1987, and builds on the data collected earlier in the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The series provides a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigates the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term perspectives it examines the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result. 
    
    Two major themes are covered in the survey, the economy and the environment. Questions on the economy include retrospective and prospective evaluations of the country's economy and the individual's own personal household situation; wages and price controls; attitudes to particular economic issues; and the position of the major parties and party leaders on the main economic issues. Questions on the environment include attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general; the role of industry and the government in ensuring environmental protection; rankings of the most urgent environmental issues and the respondent's assessment of their likely future importance; and attitudes toward environmental pressure and interest groups, including current or likely membership.  
    
    As in the 1987 AES, a range of questions are included in the survey which cover election issues and the respondent's assessment of the most effective party to handle them, as well as questions on specific political issues such as government spending and the pilots' dispute. A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care and many others. A section on industrial policy focuses on attitudes towards the control of the economy, attitudes to trade unions and big business, and to industrial conflict in general. In addition to the standard questions on vote in the current election, recalled vote in the 1987 federal election, and party identification, the survey contains an extensive section dealing with attitudes to the major parties and to the party leaders. Finally, a range of demographic data are collected for each respondent and their spouse or partner, if applicable.

  value: Systematic random sample. The Australian Electoral Office provided a systematic random sample from its computerised electoral role. The sample of 3277 electors was made by selecting 1 in 2989 from the roll, distributed proportionately across States and Territories and Electoral Divisions, excluding South Australia. A supplementary sample of 330 cases was selected manually from the alphabetical microfiche list of electors in South Australia, again using the sample fraction of 1 in 2989 persons.

    The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the Employment Initiatives Program (EIP) in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects. The Program was a short-term job creation scheme set up by the Victorian Government in 1982.
    
    File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.
    
    File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.
    
    File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 
    
    Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.
    
    File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent's general impressions about the EIP job creation program.
    
    Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.
    
    The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.
    
    The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.

    The object of the surveys, conducted in New South Wales and South Australia in 1965, was to gain some idea of the social and economic situation of persons identifying as Aboriginal in the more closely settled regions of Australia.
    
    Data on households covered household composition, including sex of head of household, visitors, duration of residence, location of dwelling, type of dwelling, land ownership, rent and payments, details of type of construction, facilities, utilities, furnishings and appliances, consumer durables and books/musical instruments, interior and exterior care and maintenance and whether dwellings condemned.
    
    Data on individuals included housing, age, sex, marital status, race,
    relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
    whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
    education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
    
    Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.
    
    Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.

    The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.
    
    In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.

    This is a study of voters and voting behaviour of urban voters in the 1983 Northern Territory election. The survey was conducted immediately after the election. Some questions were designed to allow comparison with the results of the Northern Territory Urban Voters Survey, 1982 [SSDA Study No. 368].
    
    Topics include perceived problems to be dealt with by the Northern Territory Government; voting behaviour in the election just held and in previous territory and federal elections; attitudes towards territory and federal political parties and their policies, in particular their aboriginal policies; future federal voting intention; attitude towards social class structure and class mobility in the Northern Territory; economic development in the Northern Territory.
    
    Background variables include work status; occupation; employer status;
    education level; age; religion; sex; period of residence in the Northern Territory and current town of residence.

    This is a study of voters and voting behaviour of urban voters in the 1983 Northern Territory election. The survey was conducted immediately after the election. Some questions were designed to allow comparison with the results of the Northern Territory Urban Voters Survey, 1982 [SSDA Study No. 368].
    
    Topics include perceived problems to be dealt with by the Northern Territory Government; voting behaviour in the election just held and in previous territory and federal elections; attitudes towards territory and federal political parties and their policies, in particular their aboriginal policies; future federal voting intention; attitude towards social class structure and class mobility in the Northern Territory; economic development in the Northern Territory.
    
    Background variables include work status; occupation; employer status;
    education level; age; religion; sex; period of residence in the Northern Territory and current town of residence.

    This survey is part of the series of National Drug Strategy Household Surveys, which are conducted periodically to evaluate elements of the National Drug Strategy (formerly National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA)).
    
    This survey aimed to provide baseline data on drug abuse for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, provide an indication and measurement of drug related problems in urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander settings and assist in identifying needs and strategies to address the problems associated with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander drug taking practices. The four areas of specific interest were drug use and exposure; knowledge, attitudes and policy preferences; law enforcement indicators; and campaign awareness and its impact.
    
    Background variables include age, gender, indigenous background, marital status and highest level of education achieved.

    This survey is part of the series of National Drug Strategy Household Surveys, which are conducted periodically to evaluate elements of the National Drug Strategy (formerly National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA)).
    
    This survey aimed to provide baseline data on drug abuse for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, provide an indication and measurement of drug related problems in urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander settings and assist in identifying needs and strategies to address the problems associated with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander drug taking practices. The four areas of specific interest were drug use and exposure; knowledge, attitudes and policy preferences; law enforcement indicators; and campaign awareness and its impact.
    
    Background variables include age, gender, indigenous background, marital status and highest level of education achieved.

The data covers the annual periods 1996 to 2002 and  incorporates information on crime incident, person of interest (i.e. person suspected or accused of perpetrating the crime) and victim of the crime.
    
    Incident variables include type of crime incident, premises on which the incident occurred,  type of drug associated with the incident, geographical location of incident, when the incident first occurred, when the incident was reported and if the incident was domestic violence related.
    
    Person of interest variables include person's criminal status, postcode, date of birth, sex and whether they are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Victim variables include type of involvement in the crime, presence of injury, date of birth, country of origin, sex and whether they are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.

    The 1990 EEO Public Sector Survey was conducted to determine progress under the EEO program since the last survey in 1985 and to provide information about employment patterns and opportunities within the New South Wales public sector. The study was designed to provide representative information on the employment experiences of women, Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background and people with physical disabilities in the public sector.
    
    Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects, differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of minority groups, training and development courses and own education. Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and details of any disabilities were also recorded.  The questionnaire asked respondents about their experience (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.
    
    Background variables include age, sex, birthplace and educational status.

    Weighting criteria
    
    The sampled agencies are weighted based on known workforce figures so that they are represented in proportion to their representation in the Public Sector workforce as a whole.
    
    Weighting procedures
    
    Weights for results were calculated separately for females, for males and for when sex was not specified to increase precision and reduce bias towards the female workforce due to higher response rates from women.
    
    F - workforce number of females
    f- number of female respondents
    M - workforce number of males
    m - number of male respondents
    u - number of respondents of unknown sex
    uf - estimate of the number of female respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:
    
    uf = f / (f+m) * u
    
    um - estimate of the number of male respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:
    
    um = m / (f+m) * u
    
    Weights are:
    for females            Wf = F / (Uf +f)
    
    for males               Wm = M / (Um +m)
    
    for sex unknown    Wu = (F+M) / (f + m + u)
    
    TAFE included their part-time staff in the sample, and due to there being significant differences between part-time and full-time staff, and for female and male staff, the results were further weighted by whether staff were employed full-time or part-time.

The study was designed to provide representative information on the employment experiences of women, Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background and people with physical disabilities in the public sector.
    
    Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects, differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of minority groups, training and development courses and own education. Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and details of any disabilities were also recorded.  The questionnaire asked respondents about their experience (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.
    
    Background variables include age, sex, birthplace and educational status.

  value: The method of distribution varied and depended on the size and geographic spread of the organisation. In smaller agencies questionnaires were usually distributed by hand, while in larger agencies they were distributed by mail. In some agencies self-completion in a group setting occured.  Respondents were given the option of using return mail, placing the questionnaires in ballot boxes or handing them to appointed officers.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

    The 2007 Australian Election Study is the eighth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2007 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a series of questions of Australia's social welfare system.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    weighting criteria
    
    With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each metropolitan Statistical Division and in each "rest of State" area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspaper Releases and Computer Sheets.
    
    Whilst the survey is conducted only in private dwellings, it is assumed that people living in non-private dwellings such as boarding houses, hospitals, hotels and motels have similar characteristics to those living in private dwellings.
    
    weighting procedures
    
    The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.

    multi-stage cluster sample with age and sex quotas
    
    The survey is conducted on the first two weekends of the month.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of 150 small clusters of households throughout the six states and the ACT.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.
    
    The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to 123 federal electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electorates.
    
    At the next stage of the design, within each electorate, a number of electoral sub-divisions is chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to latest electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electoral subdivisions.
    
    Within each selected electoral sub-division, a Census collector's district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.
    
    At the final stage, within each selected collector's district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous Monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is ten effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and five effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.
    
    Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 16 years and over based on the age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.
    
    All types of dwellings are called upon and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called upon in its place.

    The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Community Profiles (ACPs) are tabulations giving key census characteristics of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons, families and dwellings, covering most topics on the 1991 Census of Population and Housing form. This profile is presented at the Aboriginal Community level. 
    
    The ACP consists of 29 tables which crosstabulate characteristics including gender, age, place of birth, religion, marital status, education, income, occupation and employment status.

    The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the Employment Initiatives Program (EIP) in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects. The Program was a short-term job creation scheme set up by the Victorian Government in 1982.
    
    File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.
    
    File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.
    
    File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 
    
    Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.
    
    File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent's general impressions about the EIP job creation program.
    
    Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.
    
    The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.
    
    The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.

    The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the Employment Initiatives Program (EIP) in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects. The Program was a short-term job creation scheme set up by the Victorian Government in 1982.
    
    File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.
    
    File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.
    
    File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 
    
    Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.
    
    File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent's general impressions about the EIP job creation program.
    
    Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.
    
    The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.
    
    The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.

    The 1996 Australian Election Study is the fourth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1996 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990 and 1993 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on national identity.  Other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, attitudes to foreign affairs and defence issues and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The 1996 Australian Election Study is the fourth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1996 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990 and 1993 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on national identity.  Other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, attitudes to foreign affairs and defence issues and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    stratified systematic random sample
    
    The sample of electors for all Australia except South Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 1996 election.  The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The South Australian sample was selected manually from the alphabetical microfiche list of electors available for that state in early February.  All Australian citizens over the age of 18 years are required to enrol and vote at federal elections.

    The study has two goals. The first is to continue the broad line of enquiry established by the 1967 and 1979 Australian National Political Attitudes surveys so that patterns of stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate can be traced over two decades. The second is to assess the electoral impact of forces specific to this election in order better to understand its outcome.
    
    Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the 1987 and 1984 Federal elections; when they had decided how to vote and whether they might have changed their vote; party identification; interest in politics; the importance of a number of issues and the media in deciding their vote; left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties in the 1987 and 1984 elections; feelings about the party leaders indicated by ratings from 0 to 10, their qualities and effectiveness as prime minister. A section on election issues covered perceptions of Australia's current economic situation and the extent of the effect of government policies on the economy; government spending; privatisation; the role of trade unions and big business; uranium mining; law and order; Asian migration; marijuana; abortion; aborigines; testing for AIDS; censorship; homosexuality; opportunities for women. Other questions examined trust in government; political goals; and forms of political action.
    
    Background information included level of schooling; highest level of qualification; current activity; occupation; employment sector; supervision; union membership; self assessed social class; sex; age; length of current residence; country of birth of self  and parents; year arrived in Australia; father's occupation; parents' schooling and political preference; marital status; number of children; partner's schooling, occupation, employment sector, supervision, union membership and political preference; religion and attendance at religious services.

    The study has two goals. The first is to continue the broad line of enquiry established by the 1967 and 1979 Australian National Political Attitudes surveys so that patterns of stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate can be traced over two decades. The second is to assess the electoral impact of forces specific to this election in order better to understand its outcome.
    
    Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the 1987 and 1984 Federal elections; when they had decided how to vote and whether they might have changed their vote; party identification; interest in politics; the importance of a number of issues and the media in deciding their vote; left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties in the 1987 and 1984 elections; feelings about the party leaders indicated by ratings from 0 to 10, their qualities and effectiveness as prime minister. A section on election issues covered perceptions of Australia's current economic situation and the extent of the effect of government policies on the economy; government spending; privatisation; the role of trade unions and big business; uranium mining; law and order; Asian migration; marijuana; abortion; aborigines; testing for AIDS; censorship; homosexuality; opportunities for women. Other questions examined trust in government; political goals; and forms of political action.
    
    Background information included level of schooling; highest level of qualification; current activity; occupation; employment sector; supervision; union membership; self assessed social class; sex; age; length of current residence; country of birth of self  and parents; year arrived in Australia; father's occupation; parents' schooling and political preference; marital status; number of children; partner's schooling, occupation, employment sector, supervision, union membership and political preference; religion and attendance at religious services.

    This study is the sixth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1998. The five earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. In addition, self-completion questionnaires were administered to two supplementary samples.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, marijuana, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy/designer drugs and inhalants. This survey also includes extra questions on State and Territory regulations on Cannabis use, alcohol and drug related incidents and respondent's friends drug use, a section on Methadone, and the SF-36 survey instrument to enable a personal health 'score' for each respondent to be calculated.
    
    Background variables include state, geographic location, sex, date of birth, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and household descriptions.

    This study is the sixth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1998. The five earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. In addition, self-completion questionnaires were administered to two supplementary samples.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, marijuana, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy/designer drugs and inhalants. This survey also includes extra questions on State and Territory regulations on Cannabis use, alcohol and drug related incidents and respondent's friends drug use, a section on Methadone, and the SF-36 survey instrument to enable a personal health 'score' for each respondent to be calculated.
    
    Background variables include state, geographic location, sex, date of birth, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and household descriptions.

  value: "Four different sets of weights were calculated:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Sample 1 alone\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Sample 1 and Sample 2 combined\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Sample 3 alone\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 All three samples combined \n\n\
    The sample was designed to provide (within each geographic stratum) a close-to-random sample of households. The selection of S1 and S3 respondents was designed to be unbiased. (The selection of the S2 respondents followed a different procedure, with a deliberate bias towards younger persons and is discussed separately below.)  However, the resulting samples required weighting to correct for imbalances arising in the design and execution of the sampling.  Each respondent was assigned a weight designed to counteract this imbalance overall.  Where estimates are derived from the sample they are based on the weighted samples unless stated otherwise.\n\n\
    The disproportionate sampling by region meant that it was necessary to attach lower weights to respondents from relatively over-sampled regions and higher weights to respondents from relatively under-sampled regions.\n\n\
    Households were selected with equal probability, meaning that the probability of selection of an individual was inversely proportional to the number of persons aged 14+ in the household, this probability being taken into account in the calculation of the individual's weight, so that respondents in households of different sizes were represented in their due proportions.\n\n\
    As an initial check on the sample composition, within each stratum the selected Census collector Districts (CCDs) were compared with all CCDs on a number of measures, using the results from the 1996 census. This revealed no material bias in the selection of CCDs.\n\n\
    For detailed information on the weights for each sample and final adjustments to weights, please, refer to Section 6 of the Technical Report (see Related Materials)."

    This study is the third in a series of police custody surveys recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and provides information on those being taken into custody and held in police cells or related secure police detention facilities.
    
    Police filling out surveys were asked to provide the following details on  detainees - age, sex, time of lodgment and release from cell, reason for  detainment and release, most serious offense and whether the detainee is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is the third in a series of police custody surveys recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and provides information on those being taken into custody and held in police cells or related secure police detention facilities.
    
    Police filling out surveys were asked to provide the following details on  detainees - age, sex, time of lodgment and release from cell, reason for  detainment and release, most serious offense and whether the detainee is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    Summary details for each election year for the Australian States Lower Houses. It includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    Assembly  - In this database, the term 'assembly' is used to refer to the lower house of all state and territory parliaments even though their official names vary slightly. These lower houses are the chambers in which the government must retain a majority to remain in office. Assemblies are the critical components of parliamentary government and are the basis for broad based popular representation in the governmental process. In South Australia and Tasmania the chamber is called the House of Assembly, but in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, it is called the Legislative Assembly. The lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament is called the House of Representatives.
    
    The parliaments of the two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, have been unicameral since their establishment. In both territories the single chamber is called the Legislative Assembly and performs the same function as the lower house in state parliaments.
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the Legislative Council and being elected (or nominated) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral (Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922) and these chambers have been reformed so that they have the same franchise as the lower house and is an important component of the law making process. This database does not yet contain information on all state upper houses. The Senate is the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament and information on Senate elections is contained in this database. 
    At large election - An election held 'at large' is one in which the whole body of voters vote as one electoral district for all the candidates to be elected. At large elections are usually associated with electoral systems using proportional representation; see also multimember district, single member district.
    
    Only two at large general elections have been held for the lower house of an Australian parliament during the period covered in this database -- the elections of 1989 and 1992 for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.
    
    Ballots - a vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    Bicameralism - A bicameral parliament is one which has two chambers, a lower house and an upper house (see assembly).
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the legislative council and being elected (or nominated in the case of New South Wales and Queensland) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral; Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922 and several attempts were made to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council until it became a directly elected chamber in 1978.
    
    Change from previous election (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    Colony - The six largely self-governing political communities which had grown from British settlement of Australia after 1788 were called colonies -- New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia. When the six colonies joined in a federal union in 1901, their political institutions were unchanged and most of their law making powers remained intact but, as components of a federation, their name was changed from colony to state. For the sake of simplicity, the term state is used in this database to include the period before 1901 when the term 'colony' or 'colonial' would be the technically correct term. 
    Contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral district - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear.
    
    Electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law.
    
    
    First past the post - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    Franchise - The franchise refers to those who are eligible to vote at elections. In Australia, the franchise is now universal for all Australian citizens over 18 years of age (often referred to as universal suffrage) although, even with universal franchise, there may be some who are disqualified from voting for such reasons as serving a sentence for a criminal offense or having been declared of unsound mind. There may also be residency requirements before a person can vote in a particular electoral district.
    
    In the past, the franchise has been restricted in a variety of ways. At the beginning of the period covered in this database, ownership of property was required to vote at some elections, and most women were disenfranchised; this was often the case for those eligible to vote for upper houses in the period after the granting of responsible government in 1856. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not have full voting rights in Commonwealth and some state elections until the 1960s.
    Hare-Clark system - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    Informal (invalid) vote - In this database, an informal vote is one which does not follow the electoral rules required for the vote to be counted as a valid vote. The term informal vote can also refer to the total number of informal votes cast at an election. The sum of the total valid votes and the total informal vote will be the total of votes cast at the election. The rate of informal voting is calculated by expressing the informal vote as a percentage of the total votes cast at an election. 
    Multimember district - A multimember electoral district is one which returns more than one member to a representative assembly (see single member district). Multimember districts can be combined with first past the post electoral systems and with preferential voting, but are now usually used as part of systems of proportional representation.
    
    Multiple voting - In this database multiple voting refers to electoral systems which permit (or require) a voter to cast more than one vote on a ballot paper to elect more than one member from a multimember electoral district using first past the post (plurality) voting. It can also refer to electoral systems which permit a voter to cast more than one ballot to elect more than one member from an electoral district; see also informal ballots multiple votes.
    
    Multiple voting should be distinguished from plural voting which permits a voter to vote in more than one electoral district. 
    Optional preferences - In this database, if a voter under a system of preferential voting must vote for only one candidate, but may rank more than one candidate listed on the ballot paper, this is referred to as preferential voting with optional preferences. 
    Proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    
    The following two kinds of proportional representation have been used to elect members of parliament in Australia.
    
    Proportional representation by party list (PR-List) - Party-based variants of proportional representation require the voter to choose between lists of party candidates rather individual candidates. A wide variety of these PR-List systems (some of which provide a limited choice of candidates) have been used in Europe.
    
    A list system of proportional representation was used for South Australian Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981, and a modified d'Hondt list system was used for the first two elections for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989 and 1992.
    
    Proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (PR-STV) - The major candidate-based system of proportional representation is proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV). This has been the most common form of proportional representation adopted in Australia.
    
    It requires a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates running for election in the order of the voters' choice. The preferences are counted using a quota to calculate the successful candidates. There are several ways in which the quota can be calculated and a variety of ways of transfering preferences between candidates. Note that the adoption of 'above the line' voting for PR-STV systems used by Australian upper houses has reduced the significance the voter's ability to rank individual candidates (see below).
    
    After a trial for the city electoral districts of Hobart and Launceston in 1897 and 1900, proportional representation by STV has been used since 1909 for elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament, where it is often called the Hare-Clark system. It has also been used for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory for elections since 1995, and is used as the basis for representation in the Commonwealth Senate since 1949, and the legislative councils of New South Wales, South Australian, Victoria and Western Australia.
    Registration of voters - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). Compulsory enrolment was introduced for Australian lower house elections over the period between 1911 and 1930.
    
    Single member district - The term single member district is used to indicate that a member of parliament is the only representative elected from an electoral district. This is in contrast with multimember districts where several members are elected from a single district. The lower houses of all Australian parliaments except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory now use single member districts, but a mixture of single and multimember districts was common in nineteenth and early twentieth century parliaments. The members of a parliamentary chamber can also be elected from a single state wide electoral district (see at large election). This system is currently used for the election of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council.
    
    The choice of single member districts as the basis for representation for a parliamentary chamber is a major part of the electoral system and usually has the effect of favouring the representation of large parties. In political science, single member districts are said to have a district magnitude of one. A district magnitude of more than one is needed for proportional representation. 
    State - The Australian federation is composed of six states; New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The states have extensive law making powers and responsibility for the administration of most public services. Until federation in 1901, the states were largely self-governing colonies. This database contains information on parties, elections, governments and representation of all states since 1890 (New South Wales since 1856).
    
    There have been no new states added to the federation since 1901 but two self-governing territories of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have been created and now operate for many purposes as if they were states. They lack, however, constitutional guarantees for their governments and their law making power, and the same representation in the Senate as the original states. 
    
    Turnout - The turnout at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Uncontested seats - the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.

    Summary details for each election year for the Australian States Lower Houses. It includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    Assembly  - In this database, the term 'assembly' is used to refer to the lower house of all state and territory parliaments even though their official names vary slightly. These lower houses are the chambers in which the government must retain a majority to remain in office. Assemblies are the critical components of parliamentary government and are the basis for broad based popular representation in the governmental process. In South Australia and Tasmania the chamber is called the House of Assembly, but in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, it is called the Legislative Assembly. The lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament is called the House of Representatives.
    
    The parliaments of the two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, have been unicameral since their establishment. In both territories the single chamber is called the Legislative Assembly and performs the same function as the lower house in state parliaments.
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the Legislative Council and being elected (or nominated) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral (Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922) and these chambers have been reformed so that they have the same franchise as the lower house and is an important component of the law making process. This database does not yet contain information on all state upper houses. The Senate is the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament and information on Senate elections is contained in this database. 
    At large election - An election held 'at large' is one in which the whole body of voters vote as one electoral district for all the candidates to be elected. At large elections are usually associated with electoral systems using proportional representation; see also multimember district, single member district.
    
    Only two at large general elections have been held for the lower house of an Australian parliament during the period covered in this database -- the elections of 1989 and 1992 for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.
    
    Ballots - a vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    Bicameralism - A bicameral parliament is one which has two chambers, a lower house and an upper house (see assembly).
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the legislative council and being elected (or nominated in the case of New South Wales and Queensland) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral; Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922 and several attempts were made to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council until it became a directly elected chamber in 1978.
    
    Change from previous election (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    Colony - The six largely self-governing political communities which had grown from British settlement of Australia after 1788 were called colonies -- New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia. When the six colonies joined in a federal union in 1901, their political institutions were unchanged and most of their law making powers remained intact but, as components of a federation, their name was changed from colony to state. For the sake of simplicity, the term state is used in this database to include the period before 1901 when the term 'colony' or 'colonial' would be the technically correct term. 
    Contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral district - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear.
    
    Electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law.
    
    
    First past the post - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    Franchise - The franchise refers to those who are eligible to vote at elections. In Australia, the franchise is now universal for all Australian citizens over 18 years of age (often referred to as universal suffrage) although, even with universal franchise, there may be some who are disqualified from voting for such reasons as serving a sentence for a criminal offense or having been declared of unsound mind. There may also be residency requirements before a person can vote in a particular electoral district.
    
    In the past, the franchise has been restricted in a variety of ways. At the beginning of the period covered in this database, ownership of property was required to vote at some elections, and most women were disenfranchised; this was often the case for those eligible to vote for upper houses in the period after the granting of responsible government in 1856. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not have full voting rights in Commonwealth and some state elections until the 1960s.
    Hare-Clark system - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    Informal (invalid) vote - In this database, an informal vote is one which does not follow the electoral rules required for the vote to be counted as a valid vote. The term informal vote can also refer to the total number of informal votes cast at an election. The sum of the total valid votes and the total informal vote will be the total of votes cast at the election. The rate of informal voting is calculated by expressing the informal vote as a percentage of the total votes cast at an election. 
    Multimember district - A multimember electoral district is one which returns more than one member to a representative assembly (see single member district). Multimember districts can be combined with first past the post electoral systems and with preferential voting, but are now usually used as part of systems of proportional representation.
    
    Multiple voting - In this database multiple voting refers to electoral systems which permit (or require) a voter to cast more than one vote on a ballot paper to elect more than one member from a multimember electoral district using first past the post (plurality) voting. It can also refer to electoral systems which permit a voter to cast more than one ballot to elect more than one member from an electoral district; see also informal ballots multiple votes.
    
    Multiple voting should be distinguished from plural voting which permits a voter to vote in more than one electoral district. 
    Optional preferences - In this database, if a voter under a system of preferential voting must vote for only one candidate, but may rank more than one candidate listed on the ballot paper, this is referred to as preferential voting with optional preferences. 
    Proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    
    The following two kinds of proportional representation have been used to elect members of parliament in Australia.
    
    Proportional representation by party list (PR-List) - Party-based variants of proportional representation require the voter to choose between lists of party candidates rather individual candidates. A wide variety of these PR-List systems (some of which provide a limited choice of candidates) have been used in Europe.
    
    A list system of proportional representation was used for South Australian Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981, and a modified d'Hondt list system was used for the first two elections for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989 and 1992.
    
    Proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (PR-STV) - The major candidate-based system of proportional representation is proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV). This has been the most common form of proportional representation adopted in Australia.
    
    It requires a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates running for election in the order of the voters' choice. The preferences are counted using a quota to calculate the successful candidates. There are several ways in which the quota can be calculated and a variety of ways of transfering preferences between candidates. Note that the adoption of 'above the line' voting for PR-STV systems used by Australian upper houses has reduced the significance the voter's ability to rank individual candidates (see below).
    
    After a trial for the city electoral districts of Hobart and Launceston in 1897 and 1900, proportional representation by STV has been used since 1909 for elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament, where it is often called the Hare-Clark system. It has also been used for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory for elections since 1995, and is used as the basis for representation in the Commonwealth Senate since 1949, and the legislative councils of New South Wales, South Australian, Victoria and Western Australia.
    Registration of voters - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). Compulsory enrolment was introduced for Australian lower house elections over the period between 1911 and 1930.
    
    Single member district - The term single member district is used to indicate that a member of parliament is the only representative elected from an electoral district. This is in contrast with multimember districts where several members are elected from a single district. The lower houses of all Australian parliaments except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory now use single member districts, but a mixture of single and multimember districts was common in nineteenth and early twentieth century parliaments. The members of a parliamentary chamber can also be elected from a single state wide electoral district (see at large election). This system is currently used for the election of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council.
    
    The choice of single member districts as the basis for representation for a parliamentary chamber is a major part of the electoral system and usually has the effect of favouring the representation of large parties. In political science, single member districts are said to have a district magnitude of one. A district magnitude of more than one is needed for proportional representation. 
    State - The Australian federation is composed of six states; New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The states have extensive law making powers and responsibility for the administration of most public services. Until federation in 1901, the states were largely self-governing colonies. This database contains information on parties, elections, governments and representation of all states since 1890 (New South Wales since 1856).
    
    There have been no new states added to the federation since 1901 but two self-governing territories of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have been created and now operate for many purposes as if they were states. They lack, however, constitutional guarantees for their governments and their law making power, and the same representation in the Senate as the original states. 
    
    Turnout - The turnout at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Uncontested seats - the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.

    Summary details for each election year for the Australian States Lower Houses. It includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    Assembly  - In this database, the term 'assembly' is used to refer to the lower house of all state and territory parliaments even though their official names vary slightly. These lower houses are the chambers in which the government must retain a majority to remain in office. Assemblies are the critical components of parliamentary government and are the basis for broad based popular representation in the governmental process. In South Australia and Tasmania the chamber is called the House of Assembly, but in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, it is called the Legislative Assembly. The lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament is called the House of Representatives.
    
    The parliaments of the two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, have been unicameral since their establishment. In both territories the single chamber is called the Legislative Assembly and performs the same function as the lower house in state parliaments.
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the Legislative Council and being elected (or nominated) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral (Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922) and these chambers have been reformed so that they have the same franchise as the lower house and is an important component of the law making process. This database does not yet contain information on all state upper houses. The Senate is the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament and information on Senate elections is contained in this database. 
    At large election - An election held 'at large' is one in which the whole body of voters vote as one electoral district for all the candidates to be elected. At large elections are usually associated with electoral systems using proportional representation; see also multimember district, single member district.
    
    Only two at large general elections have been held for the lower house of an Australian parliament during the period covered in this database -- the elections of 1989 and 1992 for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.
    
    Ballots - a vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    Bicameralism - A bicameral parliament is one which has two chambers, a lower house and an upper house (see assembly).
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the legislative council and being elected (or nominated in the case of New South Wales and Queensland) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral; Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922 and several attempts were made to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council until it became a directly elected chamber in 1978.
    
    Change from previous election (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    Colony - The six largely self-governing political communities which had grown from British settlement of Australia after 1788 were called colonies -- New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia. When the six colonies joined in a federal union in 1901, their political institutions were unchanged and most of their law making powers remained intact but, as components of a federation, their name was changed from colony to state. For the sake of simplicity, the term state is used in this database to include the period before 1901 when the term 'colony' or 'colonial' would be the technically correct term. 
    Contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral district - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear.
    
    Electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law.
    
    
    First past the post - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    Franchise - The franchise refers to those who are eligible to vote at elections. In Australia, the franchise is now universal for all Australian citizens over 18 years of age (often referred to as universal suffrage) although, even with universal franchise, there may be some who are disqualified from voting for such reasons as serving a sentence for a criminal offense or having been declared of unsound mind. There may also be residency requirements before a person can vote in a particular electoral district.
    
    In the past, the franchise has been restricted in a variety of ways. At the beginning of the period covered in this database, ownership of property was required to vote at some elections, and most women were disenfranchised; this was often the case for those eligible to vote for upper houses in the period after the granting of responsible government in 1856. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not have full voting rights in Commonwealth and some state elections until the 1960s.
    Hare-Clark system - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    Informal (invalid) vote - In this database, an informal vote is one which does not follow the electoral rules required for the vote to be counted as a valid vote. The term informal vote can also refer to the total number of informal votes cast at an election. The sum of the total valid votes and the total informal vote will be the total of votes cast at the election. The rate of informal voting is calculated by expressing the informal vote as a percentage of the total votes cast at an election. 
    Multimember district - A multimember electoral district is one which returns more than one member to a representative assembly (see single member district). Multimember districts can be combined with first past the post electoral systems and with preferential voting, but are now usually used as part of systems of proportional representation.
    
    Multiple voting - In this database multiple voting refers to electoral systems which permit (or require) a voter to cast more than one vote on a ballot paper to elect more than one member from a multimember electoral district using first past the post (plurality) voting. It can also refer to electoral systems which permit a voter to cast more than one ballot to elect more than one member from an electoral district; see also informal ballots multiple votes.
    
    Multiple voting should be distinguished from plural voting which permits a voter to vote in more than one electoral district. 
    Optional preferences - In this database, if a voter under a system of preferential voting must vote for only one candidate, but may rank more than one candidate listed on the ballot paper, this is referred to as preferential voting with optional preferences. 
    Proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    
    The following two kinds of proportional representation have been used to elect members of parliament in Australia.
    
    Proportional representation by party list (PR-List) - Party-based variants of proportional representation require the voter to choose between lists of party candidates rather individual candidates. A wide variety of these PR-List systems (some of which provide a limited choice of candidates) have been used in Europe.
    
    A list system of proportional representation was used for South Australian Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981, and a modified d'Hondt list system was used for the first two elections for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989 and 1992.
    
    Proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (PR-STV) - The major candidate-based system of proportional representation is proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV). This has been the most common form of proportional representation adopted in Australia.
    
    It requires a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates running for election in the order of the voters' choice. The preferences are counted using a quota to calculate the successful candidates. There are several ways in which the quota can be calculated and a variety of ways of transfering preferences between candidates. Note that the adoption of 'above the line' voting for PR-STV systems used by Australian upper houses has reduced the significance the voter's ability to rank individual candidates (see below).
    
    After a trial for the city electoral districts of Hobart and Launceston in 1897 and 1900, proportional representation by STV has been used since 1909 for elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament, where it is often called the Hare-Clark system. It has also been used for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory for elections since 1995, and is used as the basis for representation in the Commonwealth Senate since 1949, and the legislative councils of New South Wales, South Australian, Victoria and Western Australia.
    Registration of voters - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). Compulsory enrolment was introduced for Australian lower house elections over the period between 1911 and 1930.
    
    Single member district - The term single member district is used to indicate that a member of parliament is the only representative elected from an electoral district. This is in contrast with multimember districts where several members are elected from a single district. The lower houses of all Australian parliaments except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory now use single member districts, but a mixture of single and multimember districts was common in nineteenth and early twentieth century parliaments. The members of a parliamentary chamber can also be elected from a single state wide electoral district (see at large election). This system is currently used for the election of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council.
    
    The choice of single member districts as the basis for representation for a parliamentary chamber is a major part of the electoral system and usually has the effect of favouring the representation of large parties. In political science, single member districts are said to have a district magnitude of one. A district magnitude of more than one is needed for proportional representation. 
    State - The Australian federation is composed of six states; New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The states have extensive law making powers and responsibility for the administration of most public services. Until federation in 1901, the states were largely self-governing colonies. This database contains information on parties, elections, governments and representation of all states since 1890 (New South Wales since 1856).
    
    There have been no new states added to the federation since 1901 but two self-governing territories of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have been created and now operate for many purposes as if they were states. They lack, however, constitutional guarantees for their governments and their law making power, and the same representation in the Senate as the original states. 
    
    Turnout - The turnout at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Uncontested seats - the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.

    The Australian National Social Science Survey is a major multi-purpose survey measuring a wide range of variables of interest in sociology, political science and labour economics. It is similar to national social surveys conducted regularly in the U.S.A., Britain and West Germany. Much of the data in the Australian survey are directly comparable with these other surveys. The data are representative of the non-institutionalised population aged 18 years and over, capable of being interviewed in English, in all States and Territories of Australia.
    
    The questionnaire covers attitudes toward how much money is spent on foreign aid, defence, unemployment, medical and social services, education, roads, science, aborigines, and drug abuse; other issues such as taxation, inflation, crime and punishment, business affairs, uranium, poverty, women and careers, and migrants; feelings toward major Australian political figures, Mr Reagan, Mrs Thatcher, certain social and national groups, and certain countries; confidence in institutions such as banks, police, government, political parties, the military, universities and schools, the press, companies, trade unions and small business; and perceived economic and social priorities for Australia over the next ten years. Other questions relate to the respondent's personal feelings about life, such as loneliness, happiness, satisfaction, level of control, and identity; health, the need for medical services, and availability of trustworthy friends; religious beliefs and priorities; moral reactions to sex, abortion, pornography; facets of human nature; relationships with parents and children; and a sentence completion test. Political data includes party preference and voting history; spouse's party preference; willingness to act to change things; and perceptions of personal feelings of power. Economic data includes detailed information on income from various sources for both respondent and spouse; hours and weeks worked; occupations (coded into the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations: Working Draft); and spouse's education and occupation. Background variables include family history; employment history; education; birthplace; ethnic origin; places of residence; parental occupation and education; religion; age; sex; current state and size of town; place of upbringing; number of years in current area; home ownership; marital status; number, sex and age of children; and union membership.

    The principal objectives of the Rights in Australia project were: to establish the level of support for civil liberties and civil rights among Australians; to determine the firmness or solidity of Australians' attitudes to civil liberties; to explore how Australians make up their mind in specific civil liberties controversies, especially where there are competing sides to a situation; and to identify principal characteristics which might affect the support or rejection of certain civil liberties.  This data release represents the first stage in the project: the surveying of a representative sample of the Australian population. The second stage (ASSDA No. 619) comprises interviews with a 'decision makers' sample - individuals from three groups, the legislature, the judiciary and the executive (public servants, public prosecutors and police officers).
    
    The household survey consisted of a telephone interview, followed by a questionnaire distributed by mail.  The telephone interview began with questions designed to establish a general measure of the respondent's attitudes to equality of rights and tolerance of actions against the government.  This was followed by a section dealing with more specific rights issues - freedom of speech, racial discrimination, and freedom of choice, including censorship, euthanasia, abortion and homosexuality.  Further sections dealt with: legal rights - right to trial, right to trial by jury, contact with the police; sexual discrimination; racial prejudice towards Asians and Aboriginals; and the issue of a Bill of Rights for Australia.  The mail survey consisted of additional questions covering the same range of issues.  In the telephone interview, background information was collected on political orientation, vote at last election, interest in politics and compulsory voting.
    
    Demographic information collected about the respondent included age, sex, country of birth and year of arrival in Australia, citizenship status, age starting and leaving school, type of school attended, highest qualification, religion and frequency of church attendance, marital status, numbers of children and numbers in the household, occupation and labour force status, trade union membership and household income.

    Stratified random sample
    
    The study aimed to achieve 1400 telephone interviews, consisting of 400 in ACT/NSW and 50 from each of Victoria, Queensland, SA/NT, Western Australia, and Tasmania.  A random sample of 6000 telephone numbers was selected by Telecom from their White Pages (Condor) listings, excluding known business numbers and all silent numbers.  The sample comprised 2000 numbers selected from NSW and the ACT, and 800 numbers from each of Victoria, Queensland, SA/NT, Western Australia, and Tasmania.  Of the NSW/ACT sample, 400 were used for a pilot survey.  The remaining 5600 numbers were divided into 16 replicates, each replicate containing a random subsample of 350 numbers (100 from NSW/ACT and 50 from each of the other five regions).  These subsamples were created in order to test variations in the wording of the telephone interview.
    
    Within each household, the member selected for interview was the person with the most recent birthday.
    
    Number of cases from telephone interviews: 1522
    
    Number of cases from mail survey: 916

    The 1991 EEO Survey is the first survey of the Area Health Services  in New South Wales. The survey covers the major issues in the  employment patterns and opportunities of workers in the NSW Area Health Service sector. The study was designed to provide representative  information on the experiences, attitudes and perceptions of women,  Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background, and people with physical disabilities employed in the NSW Area Health Service  sector.
    
    Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects,  differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of  minority groups, training and development courses and own education.  Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and  details of any disabilities were also recorded. The questionnaire asked  respondents about their experiences (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.
    
    Background variables included respondent's age, sex, geographical  location, birthplace and educational status.

    area-cluster sample
    
    The survey is based on a sample of 2000 households drawn from 123 of the 124 Federal electorates.  The only electorate not included is the Northern Territory.
    
    A number of starting points, proportional to the number of electors, is chosen in each Federal electorate.  Beginning at the dwelling adjacent to the starting point, the interviewer approaches each dwelling until a contact is made and an interview completed.  The next three adjacent dwellings are skipped, and approaches are then made to each dwelling until a second interview is obtained, and so on until the cluster is completed.
    
    Only one interview is obtained from any one household.  The interviewee is selected by taking that person whose birthday comes nearest to the date of the interview, is 18 years of age or older, is enrolled to vote, and is at home.  A sex quota of 4 males and 4 females is imposed within a pair of clusters (8 interviews) of the interviewers workload.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    Stratified systematic random sample. The sample of electors for all Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 2004 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The sample was selected to be proportional to the population on a state by state basis.
    
    Multi-stage sample.  An additional random sample of electors in the Federal Divisions of Reid, Watson, Fowler, Holt, Gellibrand and Maribyrnong was also drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to boost numbers of respondents who were not born in Australia.  These electorates were chosen as they have a high migrant population.  The sample of 1500 was examined with regard to the perceived ethnic origin of the surnames on the list and 790 were selected to participate in the study on this basis. This sample is referred to as the Supplementary Sample.

    The objective of this study was to provide information on environmental values, and in particular to estimate the dollar value Australians would place on the Conservation Zone and Kakadu National Park if mining were not permitted in the Zone compared with their valuations if mining were permitted, with possible environmental damage. The survey was split into two samples: a sample of Northern Territory residents; and a sample of residents of all other states.
    
    These individual valuations were determined using contingent valuation, a method of placing dollar values on aspects of the natural environment. The contingent valuation method constructs a hypothetical market for the amenity in question. In this survey, respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay to prevent possible environmental damage from mining in the Conservation Zone. Because the extent of environmental damage from proposed mining is in dispute, the survey group was split in two. A different description of environmental impact was presented to each group: the first stated that there would be very little damage and that damage would be limited (the minor impact scenario); and the second described the risks of damage as significant and the impact substantial (the major impact scenario). In addition, respondents were asked to respond to values already defined, that is, instead of respondents being asked what they would be willing to pay, they were asked if they would be willing to pay a specified amount. 
    
    In addition to specific contingent valuation questions, the survey also asked respondents a series of attitude questions ranging from the importance of recreational activities within national parks, the relationship between jobs and natural resources, the importance of Aboriginal cultural concerns, and the financial benefits to Australia. Respondents were also asked whether they thought governments paid attention to individual views on natural resources; the importance of forests and Australia's timber resources; and four behavioural questions - whether they recycled household materials, the purchase of environmentally sound products, the watching of environmental programs on TV and membership of a conservation organisation. Background information covered age, sex, education level, income, job status, industry, occupation and country of birth.

    stratified area-cluster sample with quota
    
    Two samples were selected for this survey: a national sample and a Northern Territory sample.
    
    For the national sample, fifteen strata were created, representing the States and Territories disaaggregated into capital city and non-metropolitan areas.  A total of 256 areas were selected across these strata using systematic selection from a list of Collectors Districts.  The probability of selecting a CD was proportional to its population.
    
    For the Northern Territory sample, two strata were created: one for the Darwin Statistical Division, and one for the rest of the Northern Territory.  The strata were allocated 29 and 35 collection areas respectively, and these were selected in the same manner as for the national sample.
    
    Eight interviews were sought in each selected area, with one male and one female in each of four age groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-54, 55+ years).  At least two of the females selected in each cluster must have a full-time or part-time job. Random starting points were chosen from maps of each area.

    weighting criteria With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each "rest of state" area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspapers Releases and Computer Sheets.
    
    weighting procedures The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.

    multi-stage sample with age and sex quotas
    
    The survey is conducted over a four week (monthly) period to gain a total monthly sample.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of over 200 small clusters of households throughout the six states and two territories.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.
    
    The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to each of Australia's Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to enrolment figures for April 1984.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electorates.
    
    At the next stage of the design, within each electorate, a number of electoral sub-divisions are chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to the chosen April 1984 Electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.
    
    Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector's district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.
    
    At the final stage, within each selected collector's district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is twelve effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and two clusters of six effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.
    
    Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 14 years and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample.  One person only is interviewed in each household.
    
    All types of dwellings are called upon and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools etc.  In each of these cases the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called upon in its place.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The purpose of the study was to obtain information on adult deaths which were reported to have occurred while the person was serving a non-custodial correctional order.  'Non-custodial correctional orders' included all orders which involve some form of supervision of a person by a correctional authority, outside an institution.  It was intended that the results of the survey could be used to assist in placing into a broader perspective the data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths obtained by other research studies of the Royal Commission.
    
    Topics covered in the present study included the time and manner of the individual's death, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), characteristics of the individual's correctional order, and use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables included geographical location, and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal), marital status, employment status, mental health history, physical health history, most serious offence, and correctional history of the individual.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The purpose of the study was to obtain information on adult deaths which were reported to have occurred while the person was serving a non-custodial correctional order.  'Non-custodial correctional orders' included all orders which involve some form of supervision of a person by a correctional authority, outside an institution.  It was intended that the results of the survey could be used to assist in placing into a broader perspective the data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths obtained by other research studies of the Royal Commission.
    
    Topics covered in the present study included the time and manner of the individual's death, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), characteristics of the individual's correctional order, and use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables included geographical location, and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal), marital status, employment status, mental health history, physical health history, most serious offence, and correctional history of the individual.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    The 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey was conducted between July and November of 2007 and examines current awareness of attitudes and behaviours toward drugs and drug problems within the Australian community, focussing on respondents personal attitudes toward drugs, knowledge of drugs and drug histories. This is the ninth survey in a series of national household surveys which focus on drugs and drug behaviour and is the fourth in the series conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The series also includes the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse: Social Issues in Australia Surveys of 1985, 1988 and 1991. These studies were followed by the National Drug Strategy Household Surveys of 1994, 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004. A supplement was also produced in 1994 which targeted the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations.
    
    The survey included questions regarding respondents opinions on prevention of drug and alcohol abuse, availability of drugs and alcohol, personal drug and alcohol behavior, opinions on adequacy of drug information and services and how drug information and services might be improved. The drugs covered included: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain-killers/analgesics, tranquillisers, barbiturates, heroin, methadone, inhalants, ketamines, GHB, ecstasy, LSD, hallucinogens, cocaine, meth/amphetamines, opiates, cannabis/marijuana, and steroids.
    
    Background variables included: state of residence, age, sex, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, level of education, income, index of socio-economic disadvantage and household descriptions.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.
    
    This dataset (01079-s) contains both the main sample and the supplementary sample.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.
    
    This dataset (01079-s) contains both the main sample and the supplementary sample.

    Stratified systematic random sample. The sample of electors for all Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 2004 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The sample was selected to be proportional to the population on a state by state basis.
    
    Multi-stage sample.  An additional random sample of electors in the Federal Divisions of Reid, Watson, Fowler, Holt, Gellibrand and Maribyrnong was also drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to boost numbers of respondents who were not born in Australia.  These electorates were chosen as they have a high migrant population.  The sample of 1500 was examined with regard to the perceived ethnic origin of the surnames on the list and 790 were selected to participate in the study on this basis. This sample is referred to as the Supplementary Sample.

  value: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

    The 1990 EEO Public Sector Survey was conducted to determine progress under the EEO program since the last survey in 1985 and to provide information about employment patterns and opportunities within the New South Wales public sector. The study was designed to provide representative information on the employment experiences of women, Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background and people with physical disabilities in the public sector.
    
    Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects, differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of minority groups, training and development courses and own education. Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and details of any disabilities were also recorded.  The questionnaire asked respondents about their experience (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.
    
    Background variables include age, sex, birthplace and educational status.

    Weighting criteria
    
    The sampled agencies are weighted based on known workforce figures so that they are represented in proportion to their representation in the Public Sector workforce as a whole.
    
    Weighting procedures
    
    Weights for results were calculated separately for females, for males and for when sex was not specified to increase precision and reduce bias towards the female workforce due to higher response rates from women.
    
    F - workforce number of females
    f- number of female respondents
    M - workforce number of males
    m - number of male respondents
    u - number of respondents of unknown sex
    uf - estimate of the number of female respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:
    
    uf = f / (f+m) * u
    
    um - estimate of the number of male respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:
    
    um = m / (f+m) * u
    
    Weights are:
    for females            Wf = F / (Uf +f)
    
    for males               Wm = M / (Um +m)
    
    for sex unknown    Wu = (F+M) / (f + m + u)
    
    TAFE included their part-time staff in the sample, and due to there being significant differences between part-time and full-time staff, and for female and male staff, the results were further weighted by whether staff were employed full-time or part-time.

In smaller agencies questionnaires were usually distributed by hand, while in larger agencies they were distributed by mail. In some agencies self-completion in a group setting occured.  Respondents were given the option of using return mail, placing the questionnaires in ballot boxes or handing them to appointed officers.

    The purpose of this study was to list and describe all images, including cartoons, of Indigenous people between the given dates in a sample of newspapers from Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide. Related textual information was also included.
    
    The resulting computer-readable text file contains a standardised entry for each image. Descriptive fields include the title and date of the newspaper, title of the image and page on which it is located, name of artist/engraver/photographer, size of image, description of scene (activity/background/dress/ accessories), title and author of related text, location and name of tribe, type of image (advertisement, cartoon etc.), city of origin of newspaper, and related information.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data has been retained in its original format because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.

    The objective of this study was to provide information on environmental values, and in particular to estimate the dollar value Australians would place on the Conservation Zone and Kakadu National Park if mining were not permitted in the Zone compared with their valuations if mining were permitted, with possible environmental damage. The survey was split into two samples: a sample of Northern Territory residents; and a sample of residents of all other states.
    
    These individual valuations were determined using contingent valuation, a method of placing dollar values on aspects of the natural environment. The contingent valuation method constructs a hypothetical market for the amenity in question. In this survey, respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay to prevent possible environmental damage from mining in the Conservation Zone. Because the extent of environmental damage from proposed mining is in dispute, the survey group was split in two. A different description of environmental impact was presented to each group: the first stated that there would be very little damage and that damage would be limited (the minor impact scenario); and the second described the risks of damage as significant and the impact substantial (the major impact scenario). In addition, respondents were asked to respond to values already defined, that is, instead of respondents being asked what they would be willing to pay, they were asked if they would be willing to pay a specified amount. 
    
    In addition to specific contingent valuation questions, the survey also asked respondents a series of attitude questions ranging from the importance of recreational activities within national parks, the relationship between jobs and natural resources, the importance of Aboriginal cultural concerns, and the financial benefits to Australia. Respondents were also asked whether they thought governments paid attention to individual views on natural resources; the importance of forests and Australia's timber resources; and four behavioural questions - whether they recycled household materials, the purchase of environmentally sound products, the watching of environmental programs on TV and membership of a conservation organisation. Background information covered age, sex, education level, income, job status, industry, occupation and country of birth.

    stratified area-cluster sample with quota
    
    Two samples were selected for this survey: a national sample and a Northern Territory sample.
    
    For the national sample, fifteen strata were created, representing the States and Territories disaaggregated into capital city and non-metropolitan areas.  A total of 256 areas were selected across these strata using systematic selection from a list of Collectors Districts.  The probability of selecting a CD was proportional to its population.
    
    For the Northern Territory sample, two strata were created: one for the Darwin Statistical Division, and one for the rest of the Northern Territory.  The strata were allocated 29 and 35 collection areas respectively, and these were selected in the same manner as for the national sample.
    
    Eight interviews were sought in each selected area, with one male and one female in each of four age groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-54, 55+ years).  At least two of the females selected in each cluster must have a full-time or part-time job. Random starting points were chosen from maps of each area.

The data covers the annual periods 1996 to 2002 and  incorporates information on crime incident, person of interest (i.e. person suspected or accused of perpetrating the crime) and victim of the crime.
    
    Incident variables include type of crime incident, premises on which the incident occurred,  type of drug associated with the incident, geographical location of incident, when the incident first occurred, when the incident was reported and if the incident was domestic violence related.
    
    Person of interest variables include person's criminal status, postcode, date of birth, sex and whether they are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Victim variables include type of involvement in the crime, presence of injury, date of birth, country of origin, sex and whether they are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.

  value: The 1993 Australian Candidate Study is the third in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 1993, candidates from the following political parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, The Greens, The Greens (Western Australia) Inc, The Green Party of South Australia and the Green Alliance Senate-New South Wales.  The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, employee control of industry and Australia's trading relationship with foreign countries. Opinions on other political issues such as defence spending, the need for new security arrangements, countries perceived to pose a threat to Australia, and the republic issue were also sought. A section on social policy includes questions on contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, the death penalty and many others.  In addition, the survey asks questions relating to political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations, and questions on the role of the representative, such as important aspects of the MP's job. A section on campaigning asks for candidates' perceptions of the personal attributes and experience which they think are required to make a successful candidate, how long before the election they organised and started their campaign, and what deciding factors led the candidate to run in their first Federal election. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.  Background variables include age, country of birth, parents country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, house contested, and party affiliated.

ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.  Background variables include age, country of birth, parents country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, house contested, and party affiliated.

    This study is the eighth in a series of national household surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-2001. The seven earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. For the 'Drop & collect' sample, a sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. For the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) sample these sections were asked directly by the interviewer.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/ analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, cannabis, heroin, methadone, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy, GHB, ketamines and inhalants.
    
    Background variables include state, remoteness category, sex, age, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and index of socio-economic disadvantage, and household descriptions.

The seven earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. For the 'Drop & collect' sample, a sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. For the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) sample these sections were asked directly by the interviewer.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/ analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, cannabis, heroin, methadone, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy, GHB, ketamines and inhalants.
    
    Background variables include state, remoteness category, sex, age, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and index of socio-economic disadvantage, and household descriptions.

    The New South Wales Recorded Crime Data is a compiled record of crime data obtained from NSW police records.  The data covers the annual periods 1996 to 2002 and  incorporates information on crime incident, person of interest (i.e. person suspected or accused of perpetrating the crime) and victim of the crime.

    The 2004 Australian Candidate Study is the seventh in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2004, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.
    
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on political and social institutions includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and racism. 
    
    In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions. 
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.

    This study is the second in a series of police custody surveys recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and provides information on those being taken into custody and held in police cells or related secure police detention facilities.
    
    Police filling out surveys were asked to provide the following details on detainees - age, sex, time of lodgement and release from cell, reason for detainment and release and whether the detainee is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is the second in a series of police custody surveys recommended by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and provides information on those being taken into custody and held in police cells or related secure police detention facilities.
    
    Police filling out surveys were asked to provide the following details on detainees - age, sex, time of lodgement and release from cell, reason for detainment and release and whether the detainee is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    Rural and remote areas of Australia suffer from inadequate rates of recruitment of health workers and low rates of retention.  This may partly be attributed to professional isolation experienced by health workers in these areas, while they require a wide range of professional skills.  The aim of this survey was to review current post-secondary education opportunities for rural and remote area health workers.  The database would be used to evaluate deficiencies in programs for rural health with particular reference to those involved in areas of alcohol related problems, child abuse, sexual assault and domestic violence.
    
    The data set consists of information about post-secondary courses which are available and relevant to rural and remote area health workers.  It was designed to be relevant to all types of health workers including medical practitioners, registered and enrolled nurses, aboriginal health workers, counsellors, social workers, pharmacists, dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, ambulance personnel, community workers, and other allied health and welfare workers.  The data include courses/units specifically orientated to the conditions of health service delivery in rural and remote areas, and courses/units which may be recommended for, or interesting to, rural and remote area health workers.   One data file lists each such course, giving details of the institution, contact person, subject, award level, prerequisities, requirements for attendance, and possibilities for part-time or external study. The second data file lists each unit with information about the course title, unit title, year, semester,  and course credit.

    Rural and remote areas of Australia suffer from inadequate rates of recruitment of health workers and low rates of retention.  This may partly be attributed to professional isolation experienced by health workers in these areas, while they require a wide range of professional skills.  The aim of this survey was to review current post-secondary education opportunities for rural and remote area health workers.  The database would be used to evaluate deficiencies in programs for rural health with particular reference to those involved in areas of alcohol related problems, child abuse, sexual assault and domestic violence.
    
    The data set consists of information about post-secondary courses which are available and relevant to rural and remote area health workers.  It was designed to be relevant to all types of health workers including medical practitioners, registered and enrolled nurses, aboriginal health workers, counsellors, social workers, pharmacists, dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, ambulance personnel, community workers, and other allied health and welfare workers.  The data include courses/units specifically orientated to the conditions of health service delivery in rural and remote areas, and courses/units which may be recommended for, or interesting to, rural and remote area health workers.   One data file lists each such course, giving details of the institution, contact person, subject, award level, prerequisities, requirements for attendance, and possibilities for part-time or external study. The second data file lists each unit with information about the course title, unit title, year, semester,  and course credit.

    The aims are to ascertain the level of contact of the white people of Alice Springs with the ABC station 8AL, to determine to what extent these people know of or listen to 'Aboriginal ways - Cheerios' and 'Aboriginal Ways', and, to measure the reactions and attitudes of these white people to Aboriginal programmes broadcast by Aboriginals for Aboriginals on 8AL.
    
    Topics include: radio and television ownership; whether there are any FM radio sets in the household; whether the respondent has listened to radio station 8 (8HA, 8AL, or 8CCC) in the last week; if he has not listened to 8AL in the last week, whether he has ever listened to 8AL and if so, whether he has listened to it in the last 6 months; whether the respondent has heard the programmes 'Aboriginal Ways - Cheerios' and 'Aboriginal Ways', and if no, the reasons for not listening, and if yes, how often the respondent listens to these programmes; opinion of the aboriginal programmes heard on ABC radio; whether the respondent would prefer a different format; whether the respondent has heard any programmes for aboriginal people on stations other than the ABC station 8AL and if yes, which ones; and, attitudes about aboriginal broadcasting. Background information includes age, sex, occupation, level of education, and household composition.

    The aims are to ascertain the level of contact of the white people of Alice Springs with the ABC station 8AL, to determine to what extent these people know of or listen to 'Aboriginal ways - Cheerios' and 'Aboriginal Ways', and, to measure the reactions and attitudes of these white people to Aboriginal programmes broadcast by Aboriginals for Aboriginals on 8AL.
    
    Topics include: radio and television ownership; whether there are any FM radio sets in the household; whether the respondent has listened to radio station 8 (8HA, 8AL, or 8CCC) in the last week; if he has not listened to 8AL in the last week, whether he has ever listened to 8AL and if so, whether he has listened to it in the last 6 months; whether the respondent has heard the programmes 'Aboriginal Ways - Cheerios' and 'Aboriginal Ways', and if no, the reasons for not listening, and if yes, how often the respondent listens to these programmes; opinion of the aboriginal programmes heard on ABC radio; whether the respondent would prefer a different format; whether the respondent has heard any programmes for aboriginal people on stations other than the ABC station 8AL and if yes, which ones; and, attitudes about aboriginal broadcasting. Background information includes age, sex, occupation, level of education, and household composition.

    weighting criteria With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each metropolitan statistical division and in each "rest of state" area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspapers Releases and Computer Sheets.
    
    weighting procedures The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.

    multi-stage sample with age and sex quotas
    
    The survey is conducted over a four week (monthly) period to gain a total monthly sample.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of over 200 small clusters of households throughout the six states and two territories.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.
    
    The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to each of Australia's Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electorates.
    
    At the next stage of the design, within each electorate, a number of electoral sub-divisions are chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to the chosen April 1984 Electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.
    
    Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector's district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.
    
    At the final stage, within each selected collector's district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is twelve effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and two clusters of six effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.
    
    Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 14 years and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.
    
    All types of dwellings are called upon and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools etc.  In each of these cases the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called upon in its place.

    The New South Wales Recorded Crime Data is a compiled record of crime data obtained from NSW police records. The data covers the annual periods 1996 to 2005 and incorporates information on crime incident, person of interest (i.e. person suspected or accused of perpetrating the crime) and victim of the crime. This dataset reflects the Persons of interest records of the crime data.
    
    Person of interest datasets contain the person of interest's criminal status, postcode, date of birth, sex and whether the person is an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.
    
    Incident datasets contain type of crime incident, premises on which the incident occurred,  type of drug associated with the incident, geographical location of incident, when the incident first occurred, when the incident was reported and whether the incident was domestic violence related, and the victim datasets contain type of involvement in the crime, presence of injury, date of birth, country of origin, sex and whether the victim is an Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.

    The 1993 Australian Election Study is the third in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1993 survey replicates many questions from the 1987 and 1990 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on foreign affairs and defence, and attitudes to Federal and State government. As in previous surveys, other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables covered include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, year and place of birth, parents' birthplaces, parents' political preferences, father's occupation, length of residence in state or territory, religion, marital status, number of children, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The 1993 Australian Election Study is the third in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1993 survey replicates many questions from the 1987 and 1990 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on foreign affairs and defence, and attitudes to Federal and State government. As in previous surveys, other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables covered include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, year and place of birth, parents' birthplaces, parents' political preferences, father's occupation, length of residence in state or territory, religion, marital status, number of children, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    stratified systematic random sample
    
    The sample of electors for all Australia except South Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral
    Commission following the close of rolls for the 1993 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only
    for this study. The South Australian sample was selected manually from the alphabetical microfiche list of electors available for that state
    in early February. All Australian citizens over the age of 18 years are required to enrol and vote at federal elections.
    
    The sample is stratified by State/Territory with an oversample in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania to ensure
    adequate numbers for separate State analyses as well as national analyses.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    Stratified systematic random sample. The sample of electors for all Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 2004 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The sample was selected to be proportional to the population on a state by state basis.
    
    Multi-stage sample.  An additional random sample of electors in the Federal Divisions of Reid, Watson, Fowler, Holt, Gellibrand and Maribyrnong was also drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to boost numbers of respondents who were not born in Australia.  These electorates were chosen as they have a high migrant population.  The sample of 1500 was examined with regard to the perceived ethnic origin of the surnames on the list and 790 were selected to participate in the study on this basis. This sample is referred to as the Supplementary Sample.

  value: The 1999 Australian Constitutional Referendum Study was conducted to investigate the Australian electorate's attitudes towards the significant political issues surrounding the 1999 constitutional referendum.  As part of the Australian Election Study series, the 1999 ACRS provides a perspective on the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian public which, in turn, can be compared to those attitudes recorded at past and future electoral events.  The 1999 ACRS also functions more specifically as a means of investigating the patterns of public opinion concerning the republic and its specific features.  Variables include voting preference; degree of exposure to media reporting of the Referendum; level of interest in the Referendum debate; past and present political affiliation; party voted for in the last (1998) election; evaluation of parties, politicians and key participants   in the Referendum debate; views on national identity, preferred head of state and the importance of the Queen and the Royal Family to Australia; knowledge of the current role of the Queen and the Governor General and future role the President if Australia became a republic; perceived changes to powers held by the Prime Minister and the President, political stability in Australia, Australia's standing in the world, and ease of future constitutional reform; attitudes to a range of issues including unions, big business, income distribution, law enforcement, equal opportunities for migrants/women,  Aboriginal land rights; and views on the preferred function of society, government and the law.  Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    Weighting criterion to adjust the distribution of responding electors by State/Territory to an equivalent random sample of the national electorate.  Weighting procedure There are two considerations in deriving the sample weights:  (1) Representativeness:  ensuring that the resulting (weighted) sample accurately reflects the proportion of electors enrolled in each State/ Territory. The present data constitute a disproportionate stratified sample that "under-samples" the more populous states of NSW and Victoria, and "over-samples" the smaller states and territories. Thus weights are necessary to adjust the sample by State/Territory to reflect the distribution of enrolments in the population (Australian electors) at the close of the electoral rolls for the referendum.   (2) Precision: ensuring that, after adjusting for these proportions, the resulting sample size is appropriate. Statistical software packages calculate statistics and significance values under the assumption that the data constitute a simple random (probability) sample selected from a large population. Consequently, most statistical software packages do not take the effects of complex sample designs into account. Providing the variances of an item are similar in each State/Territory, the effective sample size indicates the sample size of a simple random sample with (approximately) equivalent precision to the sample design used in the present study. When the sample is adjusted to the effective sample size, statistics from software packages can be used.  The effective sample size, the simple random sample size that would give an estimate of equivalent precision to the sample design used in this study, is calculated as:  	1/n  =  ?[(Nh/N)(Nh/N)(1/nh)]  where the summation is across States and Territories and 	Nh = number of enrolments in the hth State/Territory 	N  = number of enrolments in Australia 	nh = number of responding electors from the State/Territory.  There are 28 additional cases in the file that were returned with the identification number removed and, therefore, the respondents' State/ Territory is unknown. The weight for these cases is 1. Applying the above formula reduces the sample size from 3431 to an effective sample size of 2311 cases.  The weights, which are included as a variable in the data file, adjust the sample for both representativeness and sample precision. Details of the weights and other relevant information are given in the following table.

  value: The 1999 Australian Constitutional Referendum Study was conducted to investigate the Australian electorate's attitudes towards the significant political issues surrounding the 1999 constitutional referendum.  As part of the Australian Election Study series, the 1999 ACRS provides a perspective on the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian public which, in turn, can be compared to those attitudes recorded at past and future electoral events.  The 1999 ACRS also functions more specifically as a means of investigating the patterns of public opinion concerning the republic and its specific features.  Variables include voting preference; degree of exposure to media reporting of the Referendum; level of interest in the Referendum debate; past and present political affiliation; party voted for in the last (1998) election; evaluation of parties, politicians and key participants   in the Referendum debate; views on national identity, preferred head of state and the importance of the Queen and the Royal Family to Australia; knowledge of the current role of the Queen and the Governor General and future role the President if Australia became a republic; perceived changes to powers held by the Prime Minister and the President, political stability in Australia, Australia's standing in the world, and ease of future constitutional reform; attitudes to a range of issues including unions, big business, income distribution, law enforcement, equal opportunities for migrants/women,  Aboriginal land rights; and views on the preferred function of society, government and the law.  Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

  value: "disproportionate stratified systematic random sample of Australian electors.  The sample was stratified (disproportionately) by State/Territory in order to provide at least 500 respondents from each of the six Australian states so as to facilitate separate analysis of each state. Sample units were drawn as follows: 1000 from each of the six states (NSW, Vic, Qld, WA, SA and Tasmania), 100 from the Australian Capital Territory, and 50 from the Northern Territory.  The sample of Australian electors was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 1999 referendum on 8 October 1999. All Australian citizens aged 18 years and over are required by law to enrol (\"register\") for federal elections and referendums. British subjects who were on the roll immediately before 26 January 1984 are also qualified to enrol and vote. Citizens who are aged 17 may provisionally enrol and are eligible to vote if their 18th birthday falls on or before polling date.  The Australian Electoral Commission supplied electors' names and address information only, to be used for this study alone."

    The 2007 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA) is the third in a biennial series that studies social attitudes and behaviour of Australian citizens for the Australian and international research community. AuSSA provides cross-sectional data on the social attitudes and behaviour of Australians, repeating a core questionnaire for each cross-section and fielding specific modules relevant to the changing needs of the social research community. AuSSA is Australia's official survey in the International Social Survey Program and regularly includes ISSP modules. AuSSA 2007 uses three survey instruments (Version A, B and C) and includes both the ISSP's Role of Government and Leisure Time and Sports modules.
    
    The 2007 Survey includes attitudes and behaviours that are organised into thirty-five categories: Describing Australia; Leisure Time and Sports; Environment; Role of Government; Crime and Criminal Justice; Risk; Law and Authority; Politics and Media; Culture; Magistrates Court; Geographical Identity; Retirement; Industrial Relations; Culture and Society; Private Health Insurance; Place of Residence; Collective Memory; Financial Future; Religious Attitudes; Ned Kelly; Aboriginality; Government Regulation; Engagement with Asia; Work; Homelessness; The Sacred; Gender; IVF Technology and Sex Selection; Loneliness; Global Networks; Shopping; Politics and Society; Terrorism; People in General; and Membership of Organisations.
    
    AuSSA 2007 also includes demographic and behavioural categories (Personal Background and Your Partner) that survey: sex, year born, income, education, employment, union membership, languages spoken, birthplace, household composition and religion. Also included are questions about the partner of the respondent: employment, highest-level of education and income.

    The aim of the study was to examine the activities of graduates from the University of Sydney five years after completion of their degrees.  This is the fourth such survey conducted at the University of Sydney since 1969.  The studies have been conducted because of their value in providing a better understanding of the career patterns of graduates and to assist the Careers and Appointments Service in its work.
    
    The survey asked for details of tertiary or professional courses undertaken since graduation, reasons for undertaking further study, details of employment since graduating, salary  in the last year, difficulties in finding the first job after graduating, the respondent's perceptions of the value of his/her degree, requirements of and opportunities in present job, and whether the respondent is seeking a different position.  Background variables include age, sex, non-English speaking background, aboriginal background, marital status, number of children, type of high school attended, type of qualification, and whether the respondent was a full-time or part-time student.  Graduates who had enrolled as mature age students were also asked how they had entered their course, why they had undertaken the course, whether they had worked during their degree, whether they had obtained the type of work and salary they had hoped for, how difficult they found the study process, and whether they felt that their age or sex had affected their ability to obtain work or their progression at work.

    The survey asked for details of tertiary or professional courses undertaken since graduation, reasons for undertaking further study, details of employment since graduating, salary  in the last year, difficulties in finding the first job after graduating, the respondent's perceptions of the value of his/her degree, requirements of and opportunities in present job, and whether the respondent is seeking a different position.  Background variables include age, sex, non-English speaking background, aboriginal background, marital status, number of children, type of high school attended, type of qualification, and whether the respondent was a full-time or part-time student.  Graduates who had enrolled as mature age students were also asked how they had entered their course, why they had undertaken the course, whether they had worked during their degree, whether they had obtained the type of work and salary they had hoped for, how difficult they found the study process, and whether they felt that their age or sex had affected their ability to obtain work or their progression at work.

  value: self-completion (distribute, mail back) A four-page questionnaire was sent to all eligible graduates for whom an address was available.  A further single page questionnaire was sent inside the first to those graduates who, it was thought, may have been mature age entrants.  (Respondents' ages at the time of completing the Graduate Destination Survey were used to decide which graduates were most likely to have been mature age students.)  The cover letter which went to this group asked them to complete the extra page only if they were mature age graduates.

    The 2001 Australian Candidate Study is the sixth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2001, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, the Greens and One Nation.
    
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on what are considered to be the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on political and social institutions includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and racism. In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, political party involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with.

    The National Social Science Survey is a multi-purpose survey measuring a wide range of variables of interest in sociology, political science and labour economics.  The survey consists of three waves: 1984-1985, 1986-1987, and 1987-1988.  The sample was redrawn for each wave of the survey and therefore the results do not form a panel series.
    
    Successive waves of the survey had different research foci, such as an emphasis on the role of government in 1986-87, and attitudes to income inequality in 1987-88. ASSDA No. 594 is an integrated data set, comprising variables which were common to the three waves.  These variables included respondents' social background characteristics in addition to a number of common attitude items.
    
    Questions relate to the respondent's personal feelings about life such as loneliness, happiness, satisfaction, identity and personal worth; religious beliefs and priorities; moral reactions to sex, abortion and pornography; and facets of human nature.  The questionnaire also covered attitudes towards uranium mining, inequality, the Public Service, aborigines, trade unions, the death penalty, women and careers;  feelings toward major Australian political figures, certain social and national groups, and certain countries; confidence in the government; government ownership of public authorities; and government spending on the environment, health, police, the aged, unemployed and military.

    Political data includes interest in politics, left - right assessment, party identification and past vote and current vote intention.  Economic data include details from respondents about themselves and their spouses, of money received in the form of pensions, welfare entitlements, inheritance, dividends and  business income, which have all been adjusted for inflation; hours and weeks worked; occupations (coded into the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations).
    
    Background variables include marital status, educational history, state of birth,  country of origin, home ownership, church attendance, religion, self identified class, and trade union membership. Additonal spouse details include occupation, party identification, current employment status, years at school, and trade union membership. Background variables regarding the respondent's parents include occupation, work history and job responsibilities, party identification and educational qualifications.

    The National Social Science Survey is a multi-purpose survey measuring a wide range of variables of interest in sociology, political science and labour economics.  The survey consists of three waves: 1984-1985, 1986-1987, and 1987-1988.  The sample was redrawn for each wave of the survey and therefore the results do not form a panel series.
    
    Successive waves of the survey had different research foci, such as an emphasis on the role of government in 1986-87, and attitudes to income inequality in 1987-88. ASSDA No. 594 is an integrated data set, comprising variables which were common to the three waves.  These variables included respondents' social background characteristics in addition to a number of common attitude items.
    
    Questions relate to the respondent's personal feelings about life such as loneliness, happiness, satisfaction, identity and personal worth; religious beliefs and priorities; moral reactions to sex, abortion and pornography; and facets of human nature.  The questionnaire also covered attitudes towards uranium mining, inequality, the Public Service, aborigines, trade unions, the death penalty, women and careers;  feelings toward major Australian political figures, certain social and national groups, and certain countries; confidence in the government; government ownership of public authorities; and government spending on the environment, health, police, the aged, unemployed and military. Aspects of job satisfaction are canvassed.   
    
    Political data includes interest in politics, left - right assessment, party identification and past vote and current vote intention.  Economic data include details from respondents about themselves and their spouses, of money received in the form of pensions, welfare entitlements, inheritance, dividends and  business income, which have all been adjusted for inflation; hours and weeks worked; occupations (coded into the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations).

    The 1998 Australian Election Study is the fifth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1998 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on the constitution, rights and minorities.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the GST, immigration, unemployment, the Telstra sale, and education, views on the monarchy and the importance of Australia becoming a republic, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including euthanasia, abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The 1998 Australian Election Study is the fifth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1998 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on the constitution, rights and minorities.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the GST, immigration, unemployment, the Telstra sale, and education, views on the monarchy and the importance of Australia becoming a republic, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including euthanasia, abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The weights adjust the sample by State/Territory to reflect the
    distribution of enrolments in the population. A weight variable is
    included on the data file.
    
    The effective sample size, the simple random sample size which
    would give an estimate of equivalent precision to that of the total
    sample, is calculated from the formula
    
        1/n = sum across States {(Nh/N)(Nh/N)(1/nh)}
    
    where 
        
        Nh = number of enrolments in the hth State/Territory
        N  = number of enrolments in Australia
        nh = number of responding electors from the State/Territory.
    
    This reduces the weighted sample size from 3005 to 2370 respondents.  (Note that there are 18 additional cases in the file
    which were returned without identification and for which the State/Territory code is unknown.  The weight for these cases is 1).

    The weights adjust the sample by State/Territory to reflect the
    distribution of enrolments in the population. A weight variable is
    included on the data file.
    
    The effective sample size, the simple random sample size which
    would give an estimate of equivalent precision to that of the total
    sample, is calculated from the formula
    
        1/n = sum across States {(Nh/N)(Nh/N)(1/nh)}
    
    where 
        
        Nh = number of enrolments in the hth State/Territory
        N  = number of enrolments in Australia
        nh = number of responding electors from the State/Territory.
    
    This reduces the weighted sample size from 3005 to 2370 respondents.  (Note that there are 18 additional cases in the file

    The 2004 Australian Candidate Study is the seventh in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2004, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.
     
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on political and social institutions includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and racism. 
    
    In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions. 
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.
