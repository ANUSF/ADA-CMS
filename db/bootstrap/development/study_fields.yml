    The 1998 Australian Election Study is the fifth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1998 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on the constitution, rights and minorities.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the GST, immigration, unemployment, the Telstra sale, and education, views on the monarchy and the importance of Australia becoming a republic, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including euthanasia, abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The study was designed to test the use of the web as a methodological tool for survey research in national election studies.  The online survey ran a truncated set of questions from the Australian Election Study, 2001 (ASSDA No. 1048) that was conducted as a post-election mail-out and mail-back survey.  The goal was to compare the results from this new form of polling methodology with those from the more established method to see how far the two modes yielded comparable results.  As opinion polls become more costly to fund and response rates drop, survey researchers are looking for new and more cost effective ways to run election studies.  Although the web is being increasingly used for opinion polling it has attracted significant criticism due to the non-probalistic nature of the samples it generates.  The aim of this study was to subject web-based surveys to greater scientific scrutiny in order to assess their methods.
    
    The online survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, and attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The study was designed to test the use of the web as a methodological tool for survey research in national election studies.  The online survey ran a truncated set of questions from the Australian Election Study, 2001 (ASSDA No. 1048) that was conducted as a post-election mail-out and mail-back survey.  The goal was to compare the results from this new form of polling methodology with those from the more established method to see how far the two modes yielded comparable results.  As opinion polls become more costly to fund and response rates drop, survey researchers are looking for new and more cost effective ways to run election studies.  Although the web is being increasingly used for opinion polling it has attracted significant criticism due to the non-probalistic nature of the samples it generates.  The aim of this study was to subject web-based surveys to greater scientific scrutiny in order to assess their methods.
    
    The online survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, and attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The 1996 Australian Election Study is the fourth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1996 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990 and 1993 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on national identity.  Other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, attitudes to foreign affairs and defence issues and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.
    
    This dataset (01079-s) contains both the main sample and the supplementary sample.

    Stratified systematic random sample. The sample of electors for all Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 2004 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The sample was selected to be proportional to the population on a state by state basis.
    
    Multi-stage sample.  An additional random sample of electors in the Federal Divisions of Reid, Watson, Fowler, Holt, Gellibrand and Maribyrnong was also drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to boost numbers of respondents who were not born in Australia.  These electorates were chosen as they have a high migrant population.  The sample of 1500 was examined with regard to the perceived ethnic origin of the surnames on the list and 790 were selected to participate in the study on this basis. This sample is referred to as the Supplementary Sample.

    Summary details for each election year for the NT Legislative Assembly elections since 1974.  This data includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Northern Territory self-government: The Northern Territory did not gain full representative self-government until 1978, although this had been planned since 1973.
    
    'In 1973 the Whitlam [federal] Labor government established a joint committee of the federal parliament to plan for a setting up of a legislative assembly in 1974. But, in a style which Territorians would claim has been a consistent pattern, the Commonwealth Committee reported after the new assembly had been designed, confirmed and elected. The Legislative Assembly of nineteen members had all of the structures and processes of a representative parliament, but its powers remained the same as those of the previous Legislative Council. In 1978, however, after protracted negotiations with the Fraser Liberal government, the territory was granted self-government'
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    uncontested seats: the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. The database shows the number of voters enrolled in uncontested seats.
    
    Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.
    	
    ballots  Ballots are the papers on which votes are recorded. A vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    turnout  - The turnout at at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters; see also compulsory voting. 
    
    electoral district  - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear; 
    
    electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    compulsory preferences - a requirement that a voter must rank all candidates on the ballot paper under a system of preferential voting.
     
     contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law. It is planned to add more information on Australian electoral rules to the database.
    
    Federation  - The federation of the Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901. The six colonies which had formed the federation continued after 1901 and became states in the new federal union. Federation entailed the creation of a national governmental structure which included a bicameral national parliament (see assembly) with a lower house called the House of Representatives and an upper house called the Senate.
    
    first past the post  - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    first preference vote  - Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Hare-Clark system  - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    change from previous election  (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    turnout  - The turnout at at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Registration of voters  - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581).

    The 1996 Australian Election Study is the fourth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1996 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990 and 1993 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on national identity.  Other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, attitudes to foreign affairs and defence issues and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    stratified systematic random sample
    
    The sample of electors for all Australia except South Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 1996 election.  The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The South Australian sample was selected manually from the alphabetical microfiche list of electors available for that state in early February.  All Australian citizens over the age of 18 years are required to enrol and vote at federal elections.

    This study of teenage drinking habits was commissioned by the Northern Territory Liquor Commission in an effort to obtain information on the extent of the problem so that preventive measures could be taken.
    
    Secondary school students were questioned concerning how much beer, wine and/or spirits they drank, where and under what circumstances they drank, and where and how they obtained their liquor. Background variables included sex, age, country of birth and ethnic origin as identified by respondents.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.
    
    This is the restricted version of the dataset, which includes the postcode variable.

    Stratified systematic random sample. The sample of electors for all Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 2004 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The sample was selected to be proportional to the population on a state by state basis.
    
    Multi-stage sample.  An additional random sample of electors in the Federal Divisions of Reid, Watson, Fowler, Holt, Gellibrand and Maribyrnong was also drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to boost numbers of respondents who were not born in Australia.  These electorates were chosen as they have a high migrant population.  The sample of 1500 was examined with regard to the perceived ethnic origin of the surnames on the list and 790 were selected to participate in the study on this basis. This sample is referred to as the Supplementary Sample.

    The 1998 Australian Election Study is the fifth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1998 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on the constitution, rights and minorities.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the GST, immigration, unemployment, the Telstra sale, and education, views on the monarchy and the importance of Australia becoming a republic, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including euthanasia, abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    This is a study of voters and voting behaviour of urban voters in the 1983 Northern Territory election. The survey was conducted immediately after the election. Some questions were designed to allow comparison with the results of the Northern Territory Urban Voters Survey, 1982 [SSDA Study No. 368].
    
    Topics include perceived problems to be dealt with by the Northern Territory Government; voting behaviour in the election just held and in previous territory and federal elections; attitudes towards territory and federal political parties and their policies, in particular their aboriginal policies; future federal voting intention; attitude towards social class structure and class mobility in the Northern Territory; economic development in the Northern Territory.
    
    Background variables include work status; occupation; employer status;
    education level; age; religion; sex; period of residence in the Northern Territory and current town of residence.

    The survey used a passive sampling approach, meaning that YouGov did not attempt to create a sampling frame from which to select respondents, but instead drew in interested online users on a self-selected and voluntary basis, provided that they were a resident of the country in question.  Invitations to participate were placed on portals and frequently visited websites to attract as wide a selection of the electorate as possible.  In Australia the ninemsn's portal site was seen as having the widest usage and so appeals to participate were promoted throught Nine MSN's homepage (www.ninemsn.com.au).
    
    A number of basic security precautions were put in place for the surveys with most of these checks 'behind the scenes' and 'problem' respondents being removed from the data file post-hoc rather than during the survey completion itself.  Multiple responses were identified through cross-checking of names, postal addresses and email addresses, all mandatory fields for completing the survey.  An incentive to enter correct details during the registration process was provided by offering prizes such as plane tickets, to the person named in registration process, a valid postal address was necessary to receive the prizes as was a valid postcode.  The postcode was then cross-referenced against the address.  A valid and active email address also needed to be given.  Each email carries with it an internet protocol (IP) address.  Any replication of either would result in a respondent being investigated on a case-by-case basis; any suspicious responses were removed from the database.  Multiple registrations therefore would require different names, addresses, email addresses and IP addresses.  Creating false IP addresses is not impossible, but it is difficult, and would require a significant outlay of time and skill on the part of the user.

    Summary details for each election year for the Australian States Lower Houses. It includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    Assembly  - In this database, the term 'assembly' is used to refer to the lower house of all state and territory parliaments even though their official names vary slightly. These lower houses are the chambers in which the government must retain a majority to remain in office. Assemblies are the critical components of parliamentary government and are the basis for broad based popular representation in the governmental process. In South Australia and Tasmania the chamber is called the House of Assembly, but in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, it is called the Legislative Assembly. The lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament is called the House of Representatives.
    
    The parliaments of the two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, have been unicameral since their establishment. In both territories the single chamber is called the Legislative Assembly and performs the same function as the lower house in state parliaments.
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the Legislative Council and being elected (or nominated) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral (Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922) and these chambers have been reformed so that they have the same franchise as the lower house and is an important component of the law making process. This database does not yet contain information on all state upper houses. The Senate is the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament and information on Senate elections is contained in this database. 
    At large election - An election held 'at large' is one in which the whole body of voters vote as one electoral district for all the candidates to be elected. At large elections are usually associated with electoral systems using proportional representation; see also multimember district, single member district.
    
    Only two at large general elections have been held for the lower house of an Australian parliament during the period covered in this database -- the elections of 1989 and 1992 for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.
    
    Ballots - a vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    Bicameralism - A bicameral parliament is one which has two chambers, a lower house and an upper house (see assembly).
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the legislative council and being elected (or nominated in the case of New South Wales and Queensland) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral; Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922 and several attempts were made to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council until it became a directly elected chamber in 1978.
    
    Change from previous election (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    Colony - The six largely self-governing political communities which had grown from British settlement of Australia after 1788 were called colonies -- New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia. When the six colonies joined in a federal union in 1901, their political institutions were unchanged and most of their law making powers remained intact but, as components of a federation, their name was changed from colony to state. For the sake of simplicity, the term state is used in this database to include the period before 1901 when the term 'colony' or 'colonial' would be the technically correct term. 
    Contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral district - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear.
    
    Electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law.
    
    
    First past the post - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    Franchise - The franchise refers to those who are eligible to vote at elections. In Australia, the franchise is now universal for all Australian citizens over 18 years of age (often referred to as universal suffrage) although, even with universal franchise, there may be some who are disqualified from voting for such reasons as serving a sentence for a criminal offense or having been declared of unsound mind. There may also be residency requirements before a person can vote in a particular electoral district.
    
    In the past, the franchise has been restricted in a variety of ways. At the beginning of the period covered in this database, ownership of property was required to vote at some elections, and most women were disenfranchised; this was often the case for those eligible to vote for upper houses in the period after the granting of responsible government in 1856. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not have full voting rights in Commonwealth and some state elections until the 1960s.
    Hare-Clark system - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    Informal (invalid) vote - In this database, an informal vote is one which does not follow the electoral rules required for the vote to be counted as a valid vote. The term informal vote can also refer to the total number of informal votes cast at an election. The sum of the total valid votes and the total informal vote will be the total of votes cast at the election. The rate of informal voting is calculated by expressing the informal vote as a percentage of the total votes cast at an election. 
    Multimember district - A multimember electoral district is one which returns more than one member to a representative assembly (see single member district). Multimember districts can be combined with first past the post electoral systems and with preferential voting, but are now usually used as part of systems of proportional representation.
    
    Multiple voting - In this database multiple voting refers to electoral systems which permit (or require) a voter to cast more than one vote on a ballot paper to elect more than one member from a multimember electoral district using first past the post (plurality) voting. It can also refer to electoral systems which permit a voter to cast more than one ballot to elect more than one member from an electoral district; see also informal ballots multiple votes.
    
    Multiple voting should be distinguished from plural voting which permits a voter to vote in more than one electoral district. 
    Optional preferences - In this database, if a voter under a system of preferential voting must vote for only one candidate, but may rank more than one candidate listed on the ballot paper, this is referred to as preferential voting with optional preferences. 
    Proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    
    The following two kinds of proportional representation have been used to elect members of parliament in Australia.
    
    Proportional representation by party list (PR-List) - Party-based variants of proportional representation require the voter to choose between lists of party candidates rather individual candidates. A wide variety of these PR-List systems (some of which provide a limited choice of candidates) have been used in Europe.
    
    A list system of proportional representation was used for South Australian Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981, and a modified d'Hondt list system was used for the first two elections for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989 and 1992.
    
    Proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (PR-STV) - The major candidate-based system of proportional representation is proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV). This has been the most common form of proportional representation adopted in Australia.
    
    It requires a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates running for election in the order of the voters' choice. The preferences are counted using a quota to calculate the successful candidates. There are several ways in which the quota can be calculated and a variety of ways of transfering preferences between candidates. Note that the adoption of 'above the line' voting for PR-STV systems used by Australian upper houses has reduced the significance the voter's ability to rank individual candidates (see below).
    
    After a trial for the city electoral districts of Hobart and Launceston in 1897 and 1900, proportional representation by STV has been used since 1909 for elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament, where it is often called the Hare-Clark system. It has also been used for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory for elections since 1995, and is used as the basis for representation in the Commonwealth Senate since 1949, and the legislative councils of New South Wales, South Australian, Victoria and Western Australia.
    Registration of voters - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). Compulsory enrolment was introduced for Australian lower house elections over the period between 1911 and 1930.
    
    Single member district - The term single member district is used to indicate that a member of parliament is the only representative elected from an electoral district. This is in contrast with multimember districts where several members are elected from a single district. The lower houses of all Australian parliaments except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory now use single member districts, but a mixture of single and multimember districts was common in nineteenth and early twentieth century parliaments. The members of a parliamentary chamber can also be elected from a single state wide electoral district (see at large election). This system is currently used for the election of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council.
    
    The choice of single member districts as the basis for representation for a parliamentary chamber is a major part of the electoral system and usually has the effect of favouring the representation of large parties. In political science, single member districts are said to have a district magnitude of one. A district magnitude of more than one is needed for proportional representation. 
    State - The Australian federation is composed of six states; New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The states have extensive law making powers and responsibility for the administration of most public services. Until federation in 1901, the states were largely self-governing colonies. This database contains information on parties, elections, governments and representation of all states since 1890 (New South Wales since 1856).
    
    There have been no new states added to the federation since 1901 but two self-governing territories of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have been created and now operate for many purposes as if they were states. They lack, however, constitutional guarantees for their governments and their law making power, and the same representation in the Senate as the original states. 
    
    Turnout - The turnout at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Uncontested seats - the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.

    Summary details for each election year for the Australian States Lower Houses. It includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    Assembly  - In this database, the term 'assembly' is used to refer to the lower house of all state and territory parliaments even though their official names vary slightly. These lower houses are the chambers in which the government must retain a majority to remain in office. Assemblies are the critical components of parliamentary government and are the basis for broad based popular representation in the governmental process. In South Australia and Tasmania the chamber is called the House of Assembly, but in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, it is called the Legislative Assembly. The lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament is called the House of Representatives.
    
    The parliaments of the two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, have been unicameral since their establishment. In both territories the single chamber is called the Legislative Assembly and performs the same function as the lower house in state parliaments.
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the Legislative Council and being elected (or nominated) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral (Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922) and these chambers have been reformed so that they have the same franchise as the lower house and is an important component of the law making process. This database does not yet contain information on all state upper houses. The Senate is the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament and information on Senate elections is contained in this database. 
    At large election - An election held 'at large' is one in which the whole body of voters vote as one electoral district for all the candidates to be elected. At large elections are usually associated with electoral systems using proportional representation; see also multimember district, single member district.
    
    Only two at large general elections have been held for the lower house of an Australian parliament during the period covered in this database -- the elections of 1989 and 1992 for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.
    
    Ballots - a vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    Bicameralism - A bicameral parliament is one which has two chambers, a lower house and an upper house (see assembly).
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the legislative council and being elected (or nominated in the case of New South Wales and Queensland) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral; Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922 and several attempts were made to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council until it became a directly elected chamber in 1978.
    
    Change from previous election (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    Colony - The six largely self-governing political communities which had grown from British settlement of Australia after 1788 were called colonies -- New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia. When the six colonies joined in a federal union in 1901, their political institutions were unchanged and most of their law making powers remained intact but, as components of a federation, their name was changed from colony to state. For the sake of simplicity, the term state is used in this database to include the period before 1901 when the term 'colony' or 'colonial' would be the technically correct term. 
    Contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral district - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear.
    
    Electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law.
    
    
    First past the post - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    Franchise - The franchise refers to those who are eligible to vote at elections. In Australia, the franchise is now universal for all Australian citizens over 18 years of age (often referred to as universal suffrage) although, even with universal franchise, there may be some who are disqualified from voting for such reasons as serving a sentence for a criminal offense or having been declared of unsound mind. There may also be residency requirements before a person can vote in a particular electoral district.
    
    In the past, the franchise has been restricted in a variety of ways. At the beginning of the period covered in this database, ownership of property was required to vote at some elections, and most women were disenfranchised; this was often the case for those eligible to vote for upper houses in the period after the granting of responsible government in 1856. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not have full voting rights in Commonwealth and some state elections until the 1960s.
    Hare-Clark system - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    Informal (invalid) vote - In this database, an informal vote is one which does not follow the electoral rules required for the vote to be counted as a valid vote. The term informal vote can also refer to the total number of informal votes cast at an election. The sum of the total valid votes and the total informal vote will be the total of votes cast at the election. The rate of informal voting is calculated by expressing the informal vote as a percentage of the total votes cast at an election. 
    Multimember district - A multimember electoral district is one which returns more than one member to a representative assembly (see single member district). Multimember districts can be combined with first past the post electoral systems and with preferential voting, but are now usually used as part of systems of proportional representation.
    
    Multiple voting - In this database multiple voting refers to electoral systems which permit (or require) a voter to cast more than one vote on a ballot paper to elect more than one member from a multimember electoral district using first past the post (plurality) voting. It can also refer to electoral systems which permit a voter to cast more than one ballot to elect more than one member from an electoral district; see also informal ballots multiple votes.
    
    Multiple voting should be distinguished from plural voting which permits a voter to vote in more than one electoral district. 
    Optional preferences - In this database, if a voter under a system of preferential voting must vote for only one candidate, but may rank more than one candidate listed on the ballot paper, this is referred to as preferential voting with optional preferences. 
    Proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    
    The following two kinds of proportional representation have been used to elect members of parliament in Australia.
    
    Proportional representation by party list (PR-List) - Party-based variants of proportional representation require the voter to choose between lists of party candidates rather individual candidates. A wide variety of these PR-List systems (some of which provide a limited choice of candidates) have been used in Europe.
    
    A list system of proportional representation was used for South Australian Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981, and a modified d'Hondt list system was used for the first two elections for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989 and 1992.
    
    Proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (PR-STV) - The major candidate-based system of proportional representation is proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV). This has been the most common form of proportional representation adopted in Australia.
    
    It requires a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates running for election in the order of the voters' choice. The preferences are counted using a quota to calculate the successful candidates. There are several ways in which the quota can be calculated and a variety of ways of transfering preferences between candidates. Note that the adoption of 'above the line' voting for PR-STV systems used by Australian upper houses has reduced the significance the voter's ability to rank individual candidates (see below).
    
    After a trial for the city electoral districts of Hobart and Launceston in 1897 and 1900, proportional representation by STV has been used since 1909 for elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament, where it is often called the Hare-Clark system. It has also been used for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory for elections since 1995, and is used as the basis for representation in the Commonwealth Senate since 1949, and the legislative councils of New South Wales, South Australian, Victoria and Western Australia.
    Registration of voters - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). Compulsory enrolment was introduced for Australian lower house elections over the period between 1911 and 1930.
    
    Single member district - The term single member district is used to indicate that a member of parliament is the only representative elected from an electoral district. This is in contrast with multimember districts where several members are elected from a single district. The lower houses of all Australian parliaments except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory now use single member districts, but a mixture of single and multimember districts was common in nineteenth and early twentieth century parliaments. The members of a parliamentary chamber can also be elected from a single state wide electoral district (see at large election). This system is currently used for the election of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council.
    
    The choice of single member districts as the basis for representation for a parliamentary chamber is a major part of the electoral system and usually has the effect of favouring the representation of large parties. In political science, single member districts are said to have a district magnitude of one. A district magnitude of more than one is needed for proportional representation. 
    State - The Australian federation is composed of six states; New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The states have extensive law making powers and responsibility for the administration of most public services. Until federation in 1901, the states were largely self-governing colonies. This database contains information on parties, elections, governments and representation of all states since 1890 (New South Wales since 1856).
    
    There have been no new states added to the federation since 1901 but two self-governing territories of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have been created and now operate for many purposes as if they were states. They lack, however, constitutional guarantees for their governments and their law making power, and the same representation in the Senate as the original states. 
    
    Turnout - The turnout at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Uncontested seats - the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.

    The 2007 Australian Election Study is the eighth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2007 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a series of questions of Australia's social welfare system.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The study was designed to test the use of the web as a methodological tool for survey research in national election studies.  The online survey ran a truncated set of questions from the Australian Election Study, 2001 (ASSDA No. 1048) that was conducted as a post-election mail-out and mail-back survey.  The goal was to compare the results from this new form of polling methodology with those from the more established method to see how far the two modes yielded comparable results.  As opinion polls become more costly to fund and response rates drop, survey researchers are looking for new and more cost effective ways to run election studies.  Although the web is being increasingly used for opinion polling it has attracted significant criticism due to the non-probalistic nature of the samples it generates.  The aim of this study was to subject web-based surveys to greater scientific scrutiny in order to assess their methods.
    
    The online survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, and attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The 1993 Australian Election Study is the third in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1993 survey replicates many questions from the 1987 and 1990 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on foreign affairs and defence, and attitudes to Federal and State government. As in previous surveys, other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables covered include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, year and place of birth, parents' birthplaces, parents' political preferences, father's occupation, length of residence in state or territory, religion, marital status, number of children, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The weights adjust the sample by State/Territory to reflect the
    distribution of enrolments in the population. A weight variable is
    included on the data file.
    
    The effective sample size, the simple random sample size which
    would give an estimate of equivalent precision to that of the total
    sample, is calculated from the formula
    
        1/n = sum across States {(Nh/N)(Nh/N)(1/nh)}
    
    where 
        
        Nh = number of enrolments in the hth State/Territory
        N  = number of enrolments in Australia
        nh = number of responding electors from the State/Territory.
    
    This reduces the weighted sample size from 3005 to 2370 respondents.  (Note that there are 18 additional cases in the file
    which were returned without identification and for which the State/Territory code is unknown.  The weight for these cases is 1).
    Details of the weighting are given in the following table:

    Stratified systematic random sample. The sample of electors for all Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 2004 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The sample was selected to be proportional to the population on a state by state basis.
    
    Multi-stage sample.  An additional random sample of electors in the Federal Divisions of Reid, Watson, Fowler, Holt, Gellibrand and Maribyrnong was also drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to boost numbers of respondents who were not born in Australia.  These electorates were chosen as they have a high migrant population.  The sample of 1500 was examined with regard to the perceived ethnic origin of the surnames on the list and 790 were selected to participate in the study on this basis. This sample is referred to as the Supplementary Sample.

    The study was designed to test the use of the web as a methodological tool for survey research in national election studies.  The online survey ran a truncated set of questions from the Australian Election Study, 2001 (ASSDA No. 1048) that was conducted as a post-election mail-out and mail-back survey.  The goal was to compare the results from this new form of polling methodology with those from the more established method to see how far the two modes yielded comparable results.  As opinion polls become more costly to fund and response rates drop, survey researchers are looking for new and more cost effective ways to run election studies.  Although the web is being increasingly used for opinion polling it has attracted significant criticism due to the non-probalistic nature of the samples it generates.  The aim of this study was to subject web-based surveys to greater scientific scrutiny in order to assess their methods.
    
    The online survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, and attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The survey used a passive sampling approach, meaning that YouGov did not attempt to create a sampling frame from which to select respondents, but instead drew in interested online users on a self-selected and voluntary basis, provided that they were a resident of the country in question.  Invitations to participate were placed on portals and frequently visited websites to attract as wide a selection of the electorate as possible.  In Australia the ninemsn's portal site was seen as havingthe widest usage and so appeals to participate were promoted through Nine MSN's homepage (www.ninemsn.com.au).
    
    A number of basic security precautions were put in place for the surveys with most of these checks 'behind the scenes' and 'problem' respondents being removed from the data file post-hoc rather than during the survey completion itself.  Multiple responses were identified through cross-checking of names, postal addresses and email addresses, all mandatory fields for completing the survey.  An incentive to enter correct details during the registration process was provided by offering prizes such as plane tickets, to the person named in registration process, a valid postal address was necessary to receive the prizes as was a valid postcode.  The postcode was then cross-referenced against the address.  A valid and active email address also needed to be given.  Each email carries with it an internet protocol (IP) address.  Any replication of either would result in a respondent being investifated on a case-by-case basis; any suspicious responses were removed from the database.  Multiple registrations therefore would require different names, addresses, email addresses and IP addresses.  Creating false IP addresses is not impossible, but it is difficult, and would require a significant outlay of time and skill on the part of the user.

    The 2007 Australian Election Study is the eighth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2007 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a series of questions of Australia's social welfare system.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    Summary details of political parties which have won more than 2 percent of the vote or won a seat at any of the general elections, showing their share of votes and seats, and the various electoral forums in which they have run candidates.
    
    The Northern Territory did not gain full representative self-government until 1978, although this had been planned since 1973.
    
    'In 1973 the Whitlam [federal] Labor government established a joint committee of the federal parliament to plan for a setting up of a legislative assembly in 1974. But, in a style which Territorians would claim has been a consistent pattern, the Commonwealth Committee reported after the new assembly had been designed, confirmed and elected. The Legislative Assembly of nineteen members had all of the structures and processes of a representative parliament, but its powers remained the same as those of the previous Legislative Council. In 1978, however, after protracted negotiations with the Fraser Liberal government, the territory was granted self-government', Dean Jaensch, 'Northern Territory', in Jeremy Moon and Campbell Sharman (editors), Australian Politics and Government: The Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, pp 224-238, at p.225 (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2003, ISBN 0521532051).
    
     Notwithstanding the problems in setting up the machinery for full self-government (see note above), this was the first election for a fully elected Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. For a survey of representation and government in the Northern Territory, see Dean Jaensch, 'Northern Territory', in Jeremy Moon and Campbell Sharman (editors), Australian Politics and Government: The Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, pp 224-238, (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2003, ISBN 0521532051), and Jaensch and Wade-Marshall , Point of Order!

    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. No swing infromation is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Seats won by party: the number of seat in the lower house the party holds after the election.
    
    Data from the cube can be downloaded and combined with the Northern Territory Lower House data. Simply download both files then merge using the Election year as the common variable to create a table with both sets of data. See example in Other materials.
    
    Independents: 
    2005 Election	The vote shown for Independents at this Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (18) and one candidates who ran for office without any registered party name (who gained 104 votes).
    
    2008 Election	The vote shown for Independents at this Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (11 candidates in 9 electoral districts).
    
    Uncontested seats (2008 Election): 	Only one candidate was nominated for each of the Northern Territory electoral districts of Arnhem and Macdonnell; M McCarthy was elected unopposed for the Australian Labor Party from Arnhem, and A Anderson was elected unopposed for the Australian Labor Party from Macdonnell. This is the first time that there have been uncontested seats in an election for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and the first time for 25 years that there has been an uncontested seat for an Australian lower house election. Uncontested seats were common at Australian state and Commonwealth lower house elections until the 1960s but changes in party campaign strategy has meant that there had been no uncontested seats since the 1983 election for the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.
    
    Election dates are: 19 October 1974, 13 August 1977, 7 June 1980, 3 December 1983, 7 March 1987, 27 October 1990, 4 June 1994, 30 August 1998, 18 August 2001, 18 June 2005, 9 August 2008.

    The 1993 Australian Election Study is the third in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1993 survey replicates many questions from the 1987 and 1990 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on foreign affairs and defence, and attitudes to Federal and State government. As in previous surveys, other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables covered include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, year and place of birth, parents' birthplaces, parents' political preferences, father's occupation, length of residence in state or territory, religion, marital status, number of children, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    stratified systematic random sample
    
    The sample of electors for all Australia except South Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral
    Commission following the close of rolls for the 1993 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only
    for this study. The South Australian sample was selected manually from the alphabetical microfiche list of electors available for that state
    in early February. All Australian citizens over the age of 18 years are required to enrol and vote at federal elections.
    
    The sample is stratified by State/Territory with an oversample in Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania to ensure
    adequate numbers for separate State analyses as well as national analyses.

    The 2001 Australian Election Study is the sixth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2001 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The study has two goals. The first is to continue the broad line of enquiry established by the 1967 and 1979 Australian National Political Attitudes surveys so that patterns of stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate can be traced over two decades. The second is to assess the electoral impact of forces specific to this election in order better to understand its outcome.
    
    Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the 1987 and 1984 Federal elections; when they had decided how to vote and whether they might have changed their vote; party identification; interest in politics; the importance of a number of issues and the media in deciding their vote; left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties in the 1987 and 1984 elections; feelings about the party leaders indicated by ratings from 0 to 10, their qualities and effectiveness as prime minister. A section on election issues covered perceptions of Australia's current economic situation and the extent of the effect of government policies on the economy; government spending; privatisation; the role of trade unions and big business; uranium mining; law and order; Asian migration; marijuana; abortion; aborigines; testing for AIDS; censorship; homosexuality; opportunities for women. Other questions examined trust in government; political goals; and forms of political action.
    
    Background information included level of schooling; highest level of qualification; current activity; occupation; employment sector; supervision; union membership; self assessed social class; sex; age; length of current residence; country of birth of self  and parents; year arrived in Australia; father's occupation; parents' schooling and political preference; marital status; number of children; partner's schooling, occupation, employment sector, supervision, union membership and political preference; religion and attendance at religious services.

    The Australian Election Study is the second in the series initiated in 1987, and builds on the data collected earlier in the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The series provides a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigates the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term perspectives it examines the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result. 
    
    Two major themes are covered in the survey, the economy and the environment. Questions on the economy include retrospective and prospective evaluations of the country's economy and the individual's own personal household situation; wages and price controls; attitudes to particular economic issues; and the position of the major parties and party leaders on the main economic issues. Questions on the environment include attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general; the role of industry and the government in ensuring environmental protection; rankings of the most urgent environmental issues and the respondent's assessment of their likely future importance; and attitudes toward environmental pressure and interest groups, including current or likely membership.  
    
    As in the 1987 AES, a range of questions are included in the survey which cover election issues and the respondent's assessment of the most effective party to handle them, as well as questions on specific political issues such as government spending and the pilots' dispute. A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care and many others. A section on industrial policy focuses on attitudes towards the control of the economy, attitudes to trade unions and big business, and to industrial conflict in general. In addition to the standard questions on vote in the current election, recalled vote in the 1987 federal election, and party identification, the survey contains an extensive section dealing with attitudes to the major parties and to the party leaders. Finally, a range of demographic data are collected for each respondent and their spouse or partner, if applicable.

    The 2010 Australian Election Study(au.edu.anu.assda.ddi.01228) is the ninth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal Elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals, they examine the political issues prevalent in the current election and assess their importance for the election result.  
    
    The 2010 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces new questions regarding internet usage in election campaigns. Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, and attitudes to a range of election issues including; global warming; taxation; unemployment; health and Medicare; refugees and asylum seekers; and population policy. Opinions on social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, and Australia's security were also covered in the 2010 Australian Election Study. Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.  
    
    Version 1.0 of this data published 24/12/10 had an inherent bias derived from the sample supplied by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).  This bias resulted in significant underrepresentation of younger enrolled voters in the achieved sample.  To address this skew a survey was conducted, focusing on enumeration of 18-44 year olds, in early 2011 to "top up" the Version 1.0 data. 
    
    The 2010 Australian Election Study is the first in the series to provide the option of completing the questionnaire online via a unique password, or via hardcopy. The "top up" survey, involved telephone recruitment of a sample of age qualified persons from previous Australian National University phone-based projects (stage 1) and the MyOpinions online panel database (stage 2), to complete the existing online version of Australian Election Survey. The MyOpinions online panel database was used to enumerate age groups still under-represented from stage 1. This was considered the most expedient method, within the budget and time constraints to address the under-representation in version 1.0.  The weighting methodology (See Weighting) was developed for Version 2.0 and was used to determine numbers for the "top up" phase. 
    
    This data file is also supplemented with division level election results from the Australian Electoral Commission election results website (http://results.aec.gov.au/15508/Website/). These variables are found under the variable group "AEC Election Results". Information on the source of these election results and the method by which they were created is available in a Stata *.do syntax file located in the other study materials section.

    A study of population mobility and party allegiance in the urban population of the Northern Territory was carried out in order to examine whether Territorians see themselves as being 'different' and are in fact different to other Australians, with consequent political implications.
    
    Topics investigated include past and present voting preferences; attitudes towards political parties, their leaders and their policies; attitudes towards class mobility and conflict; perceived power groups; and problems facing the Northern Territory. 
    
    Background variables include age; sex; country of origin; state of origin; racial identification; marital status; occupation of self, spouse, parents and parents-in-law; duration of NT residence; union membership, club and association membership; level of education; religion.

    A study of population mobility and party allegiance in the urban population of the Northern Territory was carried out in order to examine whether Territorians see themselves as being 'different' and are in fact different to other Australians, with consequent political implications.
    
    Topics investigated include past and present voting preferences; attitudes towards political parties, their leaders and their policies; attitudes towards class mobility and conflict; perceived power groups; and problems facing the Northern Territory. 
    
    Background variables include age; sex; country of origin; state of origin; racial identification; marital status; occupation of self, spouse, parents and parents-in-law; duration of NT residence; union membership, club and association membership; level of education; religion.

    The 2010 Australian Election Study(au.edu.anu.assda.ddi.01228) is the ninth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal Elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals, they examine the political issues prevalent in the current election and assess their importance for the election result.  
    
    The 2010 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces new questions regarding internet usage in election campaigns. Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, and attitudes to a range of election issues including; global warming; taxation; unemployment; health and Medicare; refugees and asylum seekers; and population policy. Opinions on social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, and Australia's security were also covered in the 2010 Australian Election Study. Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.  
    
    Version 1.0 of this data published 24/12/10 had an inherent bias derived from the sample supplied by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC).  This bias resulted in significant underrepresentation of younger enrolled voters in the achieved sample.  To address this skew a survey was conducted, focusing on enumeration of 18-44 year olds, in early 2011 to "top up" the Version 1.0 data. 
    
    The 2010 Australian Election Study is the first in the series to provide the option of completing the questionnaire online via a unique password, or via hardcopy. The "top up" survey, involved telephone recruitment of a sample of age qualified persons from previous Australian National University phone-based projects (stage 1) and the MyOpinions online panel database (stage 2), to complete the existing online version of Australian Election Survey. The MyOpinions online panel database was used to enumerate age groups still under-represented from stage 1. This was considered the most expedient method, within the budget and time constraints to address the under-representation in version 1.0.  The weighting methodology (See Weighting) was developed for Version 2.0 and was used to determine numbers for the "top up" phase. 
    
    This data file is also supplemented with division level election results from the Australian Electoral Commission election results website (http://results.aec.gov.au/15508/Website/). These variables are found under the variable group "AEC Election Results". Information on the source of these election results and the method by which they were created is available in a Stata *.do syntax file located in the other study materials section.

    The 2001 Australian Election Study is the sixth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2001 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    The Australian Election Study is the second in the series initiated in 1987, and builds on the data collected earlier in the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The series provides a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigates the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term perspectives it examines the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result. 
    
    Two major themes are covered in the survey, the economy and the environment. Questions on the economy include retrospective and prospective evaluations of the country's economy and the individual's own personal household situation; wages and price controls; attitudes to particular economic issues; and the position of the major parties and party leaders on the main economic issues. Questions on the environment include attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general; the role of industry and the government in ensuring environmental protection; rankings of the most urgent environmental issues and the respondent's assessment of their likely future importance; and attitudes toward environmental pressure and interest groups, including current or likely membership.  
    
    As in the 1987 AES, a range of questions are included in the survey which cover election issues and the respondent's assessment of the most effective party to handle them, as well as questions on specific political issues such as government spending and the pilots' dispute. A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care and many others. A section on industrial policy focuses on attitudes towards the control of the economy, attitudes to trade unions and big business, and to industrial conflict in general. In addition to the standard questions on vote in the current election, recalled vote in the 1987 federal election, and party identification, the survey contains an extensive section dealing with attitudes to the major parties and to the party leaders. Finally, a range of demographic data are collected for each respondent and their spouse or partner, if applicable.

  value: Systematic random sample. The Australian Electoral Office provided a systematic random sample from its computerised electoral role. The sample of 3277 electors was made by selecting 1 in 2989 from the roll, distributed proportionately across States and Territories and Electoral Divisions, excluding South Australia. A supplementary sample of 330 cases was selected manually from the alphabetical microfiche list of electors in South Australia, again using the sample fraction of 1 in 2989 persons.

    The study has two goals. The first is to continue the broad line of enquiry established by the 1967 and 1979 Australian National Political Attitudes surveys so that patterns of stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate can be traced over two decades. The second is to assess the electoral impact of forces specific to this election in order better to understand its outcome.
    
    Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the 1987 and 1984 Federal elections; when they had decided how to vote and whether they might have changed their vote; party identification; interest in politics; the importance of a number of issues and the media in deciding their vote; left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties in the 1987 and 1984 elections; feelings about the party leaders indicated by ratings from 0 to 10, their qualities and effectiveness as prime minister. A section on election issues covered perceptions of Australia's current economic situation and the extent of the effect of government policies on the economy; government spending; privatisation; the role of trade unions and big business; uranium mining; law and order; Asian migration; marijuana; abortion; aborigines; testing for AIDS; censorship; homosexuality; opportunities for women. Other questions examined trust in government; political goals; and forms of political action.
    
    Background information included level of schooling; highest level of qualification; current activity; occupation; employment sector; supervision; union membership; self assessed social class; sex; age; length of current residence; country of birth of self  and parents; year arrived in Australia; father's occupation; parents' schooling and political preference; marital status; number of children; partner's schooling, occupation, employment sector, supervision, union membership and political preference; religion and attendance at religious services.

    The objective of this study was to provide information on environmental values, and in particular to estimate the dollar value Australians would place on the Conservation Zone and Kakadu National Park if mining were not permitted in the Zone compared with their valuations if mining were permitted, with possible environmental damage. The survey was split into two samples: a sample of Northern Territory residents; and a sample of residents of all other states.
    
    These individual valuations were determined using contingent valuation, a method of placing dollar values on aspects of the natural environment. The contingent valuation method constructs a hypothetical market for the amenity in question. In this survey, respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay to prevent possible environmental damage from mining in the Conservation Zone. Because the extent of environmental damage from proposed mining is in dispute, the survey group was split in two. A different description of environmental impact was presented to each group: the first stated that there would be very little damage and that damage would be limited (the minor impact scenario); and the second described the risks of damage as significant and the impact substantial (the major impact scenario). In addition, respondents were asked to respond to values already defined, that is, instead of respondents being asked what they would be willing to pay, they were asked if they would be willing to pay a specified amount. 
    
    In addition to specific contingent valuation questions, the survey also asked respondents a series of attitude questions ranging from the importance of recreational activities within national parks, the relationship between jobs and natural resources, the importance of Aboriginal cultural concerns, and the financial benefits to Australia. Respondents were also asked whether they thought governments paid attention to individual views on natural resources; the importance of forests and Australia's timber resources; and four behavioural questions - whether they recycled household materials, the purchase of environmentally sound products, the watching of environmental programs on TV and membership of a conservation organisation. Background information covered age, sex, education level, income, job status, industry, occupation and country of birth.

    stratified area-cluster sample with quota
    
    Two samples were selected for this survey: a national sample and a Northern Territory sample.
    
    For the national sample, fifteen strata were created, representing the States and Territories disaaggregated into capital city and non-metropolitan areas.  A total of 256 areas were selected across these strata using systematic selection from a list of Collectors Districts.  The probability of selecting a CD was proportional to its population.
    
    For the Northern Territory sample, two strata were created: one for the Darwin Statistical Division, and one for the rest of the Northern Territory.  The strata were allocated 29 and 35 collection areas respectively, and these were selected in the same manner as for the national sample.
    
    Eight interviews were sought in each selected area, with one male and one female in each of four age groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-54, 55+ years).  At least two of the females selected in each cluster must have a full-time or part-time job. Random starting points were chosen from maps of each area.

    The objective of this study was to provide information on environmental values, and in particular to estimate the dollar value Australians would place on the Conservation Zone and Kakadu National Park if mining were not permitted in the Zone compared with their valuations if mining were permitted, with possible environmental damage. The survey was split into two samples: a sample of Northern Territory residents; and a sample of residents of all other states.
    
    These individual valuations were determined using contingent valuation, a method of placing dollar values on aspects of the natural environment. The contingent valuation method constructs a hypothetical market for the amenity in question. In this survey, respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay to prevent possible environmental damage from mining in the Conservation Zone. Because the extent of environmental damage from proposed mining is in dispute, the survey group was split in two. A different description of environmental impact was presented to each group: the first stated that there would be very little damage and that damage would be limited (the minor impact scenario); and the second described the risks of damage as significant and the impact substantial (the major impact scenario). In addition, respondents were asked to respond to values already defined, that is, instead of respondents being asked what they would be willing to pay, they were asked if they would be willing to pay a specified amount. 
    
    In addition to specific contingent valuation questions, the survey also asked respondents a series of attitude questions ranging from the importance of recreational activities within national parks, the relationship between jobs and natural resources, the importance of Aboriginal cultural concerns, and the financial benefits to Australia. Respondents were also asked whether they thought governments paid attention to individual views on natural resources; the importance of forests and Australia's timber resources; and four behavioural questions - whether they recycled household materials, the purchase of environmentally sound products, the watching of environmental programs on TV and membership of a conservation organisation. Background information covered age, sex, education level, income, job status, industry, occupation and country of birth.

    This is a study of voters and voting behaviour of urban voters in the 1983 Northern Territory election. The survey was conducted immediately after the election. Some questions were designed to allow comparison with the results of the Northern Territory Urban Voters Survey, 1982 [SSDA Study No. 368].
    
    Topics include perceived problems to be dealt with by the Northern Territory Government; voting behaviour in the election just held and in previous territory and federal elections; attitudes towards territory and federal political parties and their policies, in particular their aboriginal policies; future federal voting intention; attitude towards social class structure and class mobility in the Northern Territory; economic development in the Northern Territory.
    
    Background variables include work status; occupation; employer status;
    education level; age; religion; sex; period of residence in the Northern Territory and current town of residence.

    This study of teenage drinking habits was commissioned by the Northern Territory Liquor Commission in an effort to obtain information on the extent of the problem so that preventive measures could be taken.
    
    Secondary school students were questioned concerning how much beer, wine and/or spirits they drank, where and under what circumstances they drank, and where and how they obtained their liquor. Background variables included sex, age, country of birth and ethnic origin as identified by respondents.

    Summary details for each election year for the NT Legislative Assembly elections since 1974.  This data includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Northern Territory self-government: The Northern Territory did not gain full representative self-government until 1978, although this had been planned since 1973.
    
    'In 1973 the Whitlam [federal] Labor government established a joint committee of the federal parliament to plan for a setting up of a legislative assembly in 1974. But, in a style which Territorians would claim has been a consistent pattern, the Commonwealth Committee reported after the new assembly had been designed, confirmed and elected. The Legislative Assembly of nineteen members had all of the structures and processes of a representative parliament, but its powers remained the same as those of the previous Legislative Council. In 1978, however, after protracted negotiations with the Fraser Liberal government, the territory was granted self-government'
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    uncontested seats: the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. The database shows the number of voters enrolled in uncontested seats.
    
    Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.
    	
    ballots  Ballots are the papers on which votes are recorded. A vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    turnout  - The turnout at at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters; see also compulsory voting. 
    
    electoral district  - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear; 
    
    electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    compulsory preferences - a requirement that a voter must rank all candidates on the ballot paper under a system of preferential voting.
     
     contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law. It is planned to add more information on Australian electoral rules to the database.
    
    Federation  - The federation of the Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901. The six colonies which had formed the federation continued after 1901 and became states in the new federal union. Federation entailed the creation of a national governmental structure which included a bicameral national parliament (see assembly) with a lower house called the House of Representatives and an upper house called the Senate.
    
    first past the post  - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    first preference vote  - Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Hare-Clark system  - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    change from previous election  (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    turnout  - The turnout at at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Registration of voters  - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581).

    Summary details of political parties which have won more than 2 percent of the vote or won a seat at any of the general elections, showing their share of votes and seats, and the various electoral forums in which they have run candidates.
    
    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. No swing infromation is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.

    Summary details of political parties which have won more than 2 percent of the vote or won a seat at any of the general elections, showing their share of votes and seats, and the various electoral forums in which they have run candidates.
    
    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. No swing infromation is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Seats won by party: the number of seat in the lower house the party holds after the election.
    
    For information about Parties and elections please see individual State data.

    Summary details of political parties which have won more than 2 percent of the vote or won a seat at any of the general elections, showing their share of votes and seats, and the various electoral forums in which they have run candidates.
    
    The Northern Territory did not gain full representative self-government until 1978, although this had been planned since 1973.
    
    'In 1973 the Whitlam [federal] Labor government established a joint committee of the federal parliament to plan for a setting up of a legislative assembly in 1974. But, in a style which Territorians would claim has been a consistent pattern, the Commonwealth Committee reported after the new assembly had been designed, confirmed and elected. The Legislative Assembly of nineteen members had all of the structures and processes of a representative parliament, but its powers remained the same as those of the previous Legislative Council. In 1978, however, after protracted negotiations with the Fraser Liberal government, the territory was granted self-government', Dean Jaensch, 'Northern Territory', in Jeremy Moon and Campbell Sharman (editors), Australian Politics and Government: The Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, pp 224-238, at p.225 (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2003, ISBN 0521532051).
    
     Notwithstanding the problems in setting up the machinery for full self-government (see note above), this was the first election for a fully elected Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory. For a survey of representation and government in the Northern Territory, see Dean Jaensch, 'Northern Territory', in Jeremy Moon and Campbell Sharman (editors), Australian Politics and Government: The Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, pp 224-238, (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2003, ISBN 0521532051), and Jaensch and Wade-Marshall , Point of Order! The Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, 1974-1994, Darwin: Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and North Australia Research Unit, Australian National University, 1994 (ISBN 0 7315 2077 9)
    
    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. No swing infromation is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Seats won by party: the number of seat in the lower house the party holds after the election.
    
    Data from the cube can be downloaded and combined with the Northern Territory Lower House data. Simply download both files then merge using the Election year as the common variable to create a table with both sets of data. See example in Other materials.
    
    Independents: 
    2005 Election	The vote shown for Independents at this Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (18) and one candidates who ran for office without any registered party name (who gained 104 votes).
    
    2008 Election	The vote shown for Independents at this Northern Territory Legislative Assembly election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (11 candidates in 9 electoral districts).
    
    Uncontested seats (2008 Election): 	Only one candidate was nominated for each of the Northern Territory electoral districts of Arnhem and Macdonnell; M McCarthy was elected unopposed for the Australian Labor Party from Arnhem, and A Anderson was elected unopposed for the Australian Labor Party from Macdonnell. This is the first time that there have been uncontested seats in an election for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and the first time for 25 years that there has been an uncontested seat for an Australian lower house election. Uncontested seats were common at Australian state and Commonwealth lower house elections until the 1960s but changes in party campaign strategy has meant that there had been no uncontested seats since the 1983 election for the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.
    
    Election dates are: 19 October 1974, 13 August 1977, 7 June 1980, 3 December 1983, 7 March 1987, 27 October 1990, 4 June 1994, 30 August 1998, 18 August 2001, 18 June 2005, 9 August 2008.
