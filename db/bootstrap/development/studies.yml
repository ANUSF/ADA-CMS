    The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the Employment Initiatives Program (EIP) in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects. The Program was a short-term job creation scheme set up by the Victorian Government in 1982.
    
    File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.
    
    File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.
    
    File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 
    
    Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.
    
    File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent's general impressions about the EIP job creation program.
    
    Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.
    
    The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.
    
    The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.

In 2007, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.
    
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on demography and representation includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy and referendums
    
    In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. 
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.

    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentages first preference vote shares. No swing information is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Liberal Party and Ministerialists
    During the 1890s and early 1900s, factional politics began to give way to political groupings and electoral organizations which foreshadowed the emergence of modern political parties. The term Ministerialists is applied to groupings which, for a variety of reasons, supported a particular government but were not bound by party discipline. By 1911, the emergence of the Labor Party had the effect of polarizing parliamentary politics to that '[v]irtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 223, label the Forrest ministry as 'Protections or Conservative', but the terms reflect the predisposition of the Premier and his supporting group rather than a party organization.
    
    At the 1894 election, the existence of '... a reigning ministry gave [the election] a sharper focus than that of 1890, but it was still predominantly a matter of each candidate running his own campaign with the aid of a local committee. Although Forrest had occasionally called meetings of his supporters in Parliament over the previous four years, there is no evidence to suggest he had any say in the nomination of candidates', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 72.
    
    At the 1876 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Forrest government were more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent' in the table above (see see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 74). Campaigning was undertaken by various trade union groups which would form the basis for the Labor Party at future elections; see generally, H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 341-387, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035); pp 318-321 provide commentary on the 1897 election.
    
    At the 1901 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Throssell government and its policies were becoming more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent', in the table above, although '... many candidates had only the loosest connection with either the Ministerialist or the Opposition group', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 569. The success of candidates affiliated with the labour movement was to hasten the development of modern partisan politics; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    At the 1904 election, politics began to be polarized between Ministerialist candidates, some of whom ran as 'Liberals', and those affiliated with the labour movement; those candidates who ran as Liberals '... were supported by the National Political League formed in March 1904', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570. For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    The 1905 election '... completed the trend towards a two-party Assembly which James [the previous Ministerialist Premier] had encouraged the year before. The Independents all either lost their seats or were driven into the arms of the Ministerialists, who won 35 of the 50 seats .... As was occurring elsewhere in Australia at about the same time, parliamentary politics became permanently established as a conflict between Labor and non-Labor, in preference to other possible patterns', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    By the 1908 election, the success of the Labor Party had had the effect of encouraging the creation of a single non-Labor grouping. 'Although the term 'Liberal Party' did not come into general use until 1911 ... there were two "clearly opposed and fairly evenly balanced political parties" [reference to Hyams, see below]. Virtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor. The degree of non-Labor unity within parliament was not immediately paralleled by the formation of an integrated extra-parliamentary organization ...', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    For a detailed study of non-Labor politics in this period, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354, at pp 346-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035), and note B K Hyams, 'Western Australian Political Parties, 1901-1916', University Studies in History and Economics, [University of Western Australia], 2(3), September 1955: 48-61.
    
    'At the 1911 election, the Ministerialists campaigned for the first time as the Liberal party, bringing them into conformity with the federal party and the [Liberal] League', Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354, at p. 354, (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035). At pp. 346-354 of this essay, de Garis provides a detailed study of non-Labor politics in this period; note also B K Hyams, 'Western Australian Political Parties, 1901-1916', University Studies in History and Economics, [University of Western Australia], 2(3), September 1955: 48-61.
    Liberals for Forests: At the 2001 Election Janet Woollard was elected to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2001, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2001 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2001, ISBN 0730761010), also online at : http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010]). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    
    Labor candidates: 
    
    The 1901 election is the first election for the Legislative Assembly at which candidates were elected who was affiliated to the labour movement. The votes for these candidates are shown as being votes for the Australian Labor Party even though such an organization had not yet been formed. Several bodies competed to represent the labour movement; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p.82); and H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    Candidates affiliated with labour organizations contested 33 electoral districts at the 1904 election and won 22 seats, more than any other party grouping. The party was able to gain enough parliamentary support after the election to replace the James Ministerialist government with a minority Australian Labor Party government; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: p.88; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In the 1905 Election,'Labor was caught ill-prepared and its representation shrank to 15, but the establishment of a clear two-party system of which it was the most sharply defined member, was certainly to its long-term advantage', see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    The split in the Australian Labor Party over the issue of conscription in 1916 had led to a number of its Assembly members defecting to form a National Labor as part of the Nationalist Coalition government which supported conscription; see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, at pp. 369-373, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).

    At the 1921 election, the Australian Labor Party regained some of its electoral support, much of this being at the expense of National Labor Party members who continued to support the Nationalist Coalition government.

    Democratic Labor Party: The Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement suffered major internal divisions in the 1950s which came to a head in 1955 with a split in some state branches of the Party and the creation of what was to become the Democratic Labor Party; for an extensive study of this period, see Robert Murray, The Split: Australian Labor in the Fifties, (Melbourne: Cheshire, 1972, ISBN 0701516755).

    Democratic Party: This party fielded five candidates at this election. It was formed in 1968 and favoured a free enterprise system, opposition to government funding of non-government schools, and a range of other policies; see Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, p.82 (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217) [Jaensch and Mathieson refer to this party as 'Democratic Party (3)' to distinguish it from other parties with the same name].?
    Independents: 'During the term of the Leake ministry (1901 to 1904), the Government and Opposition drew closer together; by the 1904 election the old Forrest 'Conservative' group had become 'Independents' in name', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570.
    
    The Independent member elected at the 1993 election was Elizabeth Constable, who retained the seat of Floreat which she had won in a by-election as an Independent in 1991; Constable viewed herself as an Independent Liberal having originally run for election as the consequence of a factional dispute over candidate endorsement within the Liberal Party.
    
    The three Independents elected at the 1996 election were Ernest Bridge (Kimberley) who had defected from the Australian Labor Party in 1995 after having been the Labor member for Kimberley since 1977; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) who regarded herself as an Independent Liberal since the time of her first entry to the Assembly in a by-election in 1991; and Phillip Pendal (South Perth), who had been elected to the Assembly at the previous election (1993) as a member of the Liberal Party, and sat after this election (1996) as an Independent Liberal.
    
    The vote shown for Independents at this election (2001) is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (54) and those candidates who ran for office without any registered party name (5), a total of 59 such candidates.
    
    Three of the Independent candidates were elected in the 2001 Election, (four if the Liberals for Forests candidate Woolard is included; see Liberals for Forests). Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Phillip Pendal (South Perth) were re-elected as Independents (sitting as Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Larry Graham, who had been denied endorsement by the Labor Party for the seat of Pilbara, ran as an Independent candidate and won the seat.
    
    The vote shown for independents at the 2005 election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (39) and two candidates who ran for office without any registered party name, a total of 41 such candidates.
    
    Two of the Independent candidates were elected; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Janet Woollard (Alfred Cove) were re-elected. Constable sat as an Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Woollard, in spite of being being elected under the banner of the unregistered Liberals for Forests party in 2001, and this party label being registered as a political party in 2005, ran as an Independent at this election (2005); see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2005, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2005 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2006, ISBN 1920886664); also online at: http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010].

    Liberal Party: For a study of the Liberal Party in the 1911 to 1922 period, see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 195-201 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and note David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    The Liberal Party was also affected by the issue of conscription and the First World War; some of its Assembly members saw themselves as being affiliated with such newly formed Nationalist organizations as the National League, while others campaigned as Liberals who were part of the Nationalist Coalition government; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 197-198 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In this database, former Liberal candidates who campaigned with the support of the National League are referred to as affiliated with the Nationalist Party even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Liberal Party and Liberal and Country League: In 1949, a public meeting '... attended by several hundred people from various parts of the state approved the formation of the Liberal and Country League (LCL) .... The Liberal Party agreed to submerge its identity in the new party...' David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p.218 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Black argues that this change of name was part of a continuing struggle between the Liberal Party and the Country Party; see David Black, 'The Liberals Triumphant: The Politics of Development 1947-1980', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 441-470, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819). 
    Liberals for Forests: Janet Woollard was elected  at the 2001 Election to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Green in 'Sources', below details). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    Country Party: 'The decision of the FSA [Western Australian Farmers and Settlers Association] to form a third political party was taken in 1913 and grew out of the belief among farmers that their interests were neglected by both the existing parties, Labor and Liberal', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 159 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495); for a survey and analysis of the rise of country parties across Australia, see B D Graham, The Formation of the Australian Country Parties, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1966).
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Under Premier Mitchell, the Country Party members became increasingly dissatisfied with the conduct of the Nationalist Coalition government but '... the party had not yet found a formula enabling it to combine its independent identity with its membership of coalition government', Layman, p. 164.
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Some candidates affiliated with the Country Party chose to run without any commitment to the National Coalition government.
    
    Tensions within the Country Party over its role in the National Coalition government of Premier Mitchell led to strains between the Primary Producers Association (PPA) and Country Party members of parliament. In 1923, these disagreements came to a head with the executive of the PPA refusing to endorse several sitting Country Party members. As a consequence, the Party split between those who supported continued close cooperation between Country Party members and the National Coalition (the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party), and those who wished Country Party members to follow a more independent line (the Executive Country Party). Both these groups fielded candidates at this Legislative Assembly election (1924).
    
    For details of this Country Party split, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819), p. 105.
    
    The creation of the United Party meant that there was only one group which claimed the name Country Party for this Legislative Assembly election (1927); on the Country Party during this period, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    The Country Party had suffered a major split in 1923 but had undergone a major reorganization to rebuild its electoral base and parliamentary support in the years leading up to the 1930 election. Its defeat at the 1936 election condemned it to another stint on the opposition benches see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 164-167 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    At the 1944 conference of the Primary Producers Association (PPA), a motion was passed which terminated the administrative arrangements through which the Country Party had been the political wing of the PPA. Its newly acquired political autonomy required the party to create its own organization and source of funds. As part of this reorganization, the party changed its name to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 167-170 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Country Party and Country and Democratic League: The Country Party had changed its name in 1944 to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; the parliamentary party -- but not the organization -- reverted to the name Country Party in 1949. But the party faced strong competition from the Liberals and lost three seats at this election (1950); see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    After the electoral changes of 1947, demographic trends and competition from the Liberals, the Democratic League struggled to maintain its representation; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495.

    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see Lenore Layman, 'Continuity and Change 1947-1965', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 153-183, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    National Alliance and Country Party: In the face of dwindling electoral support and vigorous competition from the Liberal Party, the Country Party merged with the Democratic Labor Party to form the National Alliance '... an unlikely union given the very different social roots and political concerns of the two', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.183 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Not all Country Party parliamentary members joined the new party, and some candidates had joint endorsement for both the Country Party and the National Alliance, three members were elected with National Alliance endorsement (H J Cowan, A V Crane, and W P McPharlin), two with joint endorsement from the Country Party and National Alliance (R C Old and P Jones), and one with endorsement from the Country Party alone (M E Stephens).
    
    The poor performance of the fused party led the Country Party to revert to its previous name and organization after the 1974 election; support for the Democratic Labor Party had collapsed after the election of the Whitlam Australian Labor Party government in Canberra in 1972. 
    National Country Party and Country Party: In response to tensions within the party, and in a further attempt to redefine its role and broaden its electoral appeal, the Country Party changed its name in 1975 to the National Country Party; for context and analysis, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.184 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084)
    A split within the National Country Party in 1978 led to '... the existence of two parties: the larger and more conservative National Country Party (NCP), the Liberals' coalition partner, and the smaller, more radical National Party (NP) playing a cross-bench role. The 1978 split was the culmination of a period of uncertainty as the party tried a number of strategies to arrest electoral decline', Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at p. 109 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084).
    As foreshadowed by Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at pp 116-118 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084) the parties started a process of reunification in 1984 which was completed by 1986 under the name of the National Party of Australia (in this database the name National Party is used for the reunited party to simplify comparisons with other states and to conform to common usage). Not all parliamentary members of the National Country Party accepted the terms for reunion; for brief a comment on the consequences of reuniting the party, see Harry Phillips, 'The Modern Parliament, 1965-1989', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 185-262, at pp 226-246, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839) p. 232.
    
    United Party: The split in the Country Party in 1923 led to the existence of two Country parties, the Executive Country Party, and the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party. The Majority Country Party, '... after an unsuccessful attempt to form their own Independent Country Party, joined with the National League [Nationalist Party] and the remnants of the National Labor Party to form the United Party', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 202 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). At the election, individual candidates campaigning under the banner of the United Party maintained their links to Nationalist or Country Party organizations.?
    Nationalist Coalition The realignment of parties in 1916-1917 led to the creation of a Nationalist Coalition comprising all non-Labor groupings .The Nationalist Coalition had features of both a coalition and a political party and is treated as a single partisan affiliation for the governments of Western Australia between 1917 and 1924. The component groupings maintained their separate identities and became increasingly autonomous after 1917.
    
    The Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Coalition government had been formed as part of the realignment political support that had been prompted by the conscription crisis and the First World War. The Nationalist Party had absorbed most of the support of the Liberal Party but had only a fragmented organization and its relationship with the Liberal League was unclear. Members elected as Nationalists were dominant in the Nationalist Coalition government of Mitchell  (1921 to 1924); see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 98 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and see 'References', below .
    
    With the defeat of the Nationalist Coalition government at the 1924 election the coalition disbanded, and its constituent parties operated as independent entities.
    
    The Nationalist Party (Nationalists) was the successor to the Liberal Party which had existed before the First World War, but its support was heavily concentrated in the electoral districts of metropolitan Perth; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 201-204 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and For the political context of this election (1924), see David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see David Black, 'Factionalism and Stability, 1911-1947', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 97-151, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    
    The formation of the United Party meant that members of the Nationalist Party ran as United Party candidates. In this database, then party name Nationalist Party (Nationalists) is used even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    The restructuring of the Country Party contrasted with the weak organization of the Nationalist Party during this period and growing tensions within the party over the secession movement in Western Australia. But this did not prevent the party's success at the 1930 election and its ability to be the dominant partner in the governing coalition; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 204-206, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    The defeat at the 1933 election exacerbated the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In 1931, the federal Parliamentary Labor Party in Canberra split over Depression finance policies, and some members of Labor Party joined with the Nationalist Party to form the United Australia Party under the leadership of Joseph Lyons (see generally, Clem Lloyd, 'The Rise and Fall of the United Australia Party', in J R Nethercote (editor), Liberalism and the Australian Federation pp 113-133, (Sydney: Federation Press, 2001, ISBN 1862874026). The political context of Western Australian politics did not lead to the creation of a WA branch of the United Australia Party; the Nationalist Party retained its name but cooperated with the federal party at federal elections. 
    The defeat at the 1936 election continued the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Independent Nationalist: The only Independent Nationalist candidate was Harry Shearn who won the seat of Maylands at this election without a contest (he had held the seat without any party endorsement since 1936); no party nominated a candidate to run against him at the 1947 election.?
    Women's Electoral League: The votes for this party grouping were all cast for Edith Cowan who ran as a candidate for the League in the electoral district of East Perth. Edith Cowan was the first woman elected to any Australian parliament; she had won the seat of Perth West as a Nationalist Candidate for the Legislative Assembly in 1921, but was defeated (by a rival Nationalist Party candidate) at the 1924 election.

The votes shown for Social Credit at the 1933 election were cast for a single candidate, E H White, who contested the seat of Perth North as a 'Single Tax' candidate; see Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, Voting for the South Australian, Western Australian and Tasmanian Lower Houses 1890-1964, (Canberra: Department of Political Science, Research School of Social Sciences, Australian National University, 1976, ISBN 0708113346).
    Australia Party: This party emerged as a group to reform the federal Liberal Party in 1966; while its primary focus was on national politics, it fielded candidates at various state elections in all mainland states between 1971 and 1979; see Keith Richmond, 'Minor Parties in Australia', in Graeme Starr, Keith Richmond and Graham Maddox (editors), Political Parties in Australia, pp 317-384, at 344-351, and note Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, pp 32-33, (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217). The party fielded 6 candidates at this Assembly election (1974).
    Progress Party: This party was committed to greatly reduced state intervention in social and economic affairs; see Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, p.146 (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217). The party fielded 5 candidates at this election (1977) and 3 candidates at this election (1980).
    
    Australian Democrats: The Australian Democrats emerged as a centre party immediately preceding the 1977 federal election to capture the support of voters who were dissatisfied with both the Labor and Liberal parties; see John Warhurst (editor), Keeping the Bastards Honest: The Australian Democrats' First Twenty Years, (St. Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1997, ISBN 1864484209). The Australian Democrats fielded candidates for House of Representatives and Senate seats in Western Australia from 1977. This was the first Legislative Assembly election contested by the party in Western Australia; the party fielded 10 candidates at this election (1980).

    Definitions for First Preference votes, Swing and Seats Won by Party are:
    First preference  votes: Percentage of first preference votes won by a party at each election. Preferential voting requires a voter to rank candidates on the ballot paper in the order of the voter's choice. A voter's most preferred candidate is the one against whose name the voter has written '1' on the ballot paper. This candidate represents the voter's first preference vote. This definition also applies to voting under systems of proportional representation. Where a first past the post (plurality) electoral system is used, the first preference vote refers to the number of ticks or crosses gained by each candidate.
    
    Swing: Percentage of the change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentages first preference vote shares. No swing information is given for parties contesting their first election or who did not contest the last the election.
    
    Liberal Party and Ministerialists
    During the 1890s and early 1900s, factional politics began to give way to political groupings and electoral organizations which foreshadowed the emergence of modern political parties. The term Ministerialists is applied to groupings which, for a variety of reasons, supported a particular government but were not bound by party discipline. By 1911, the emergence of the Labor Party had the effect of polarizing parliamentary politics to that '[v]irtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 223, label the Forrest ministry as 'Protections or Conservative', but the terms reflect the predisposition of the Premier and his supporting group rather than a party organization.
    
    At the 1894 election, the existence of '... a reigning ministry gave [the election] a sharper focus than that of 1890, but it was still predominantly a matter of each candidate running his own campaign with the aid of a local committee. Although Forrest had occasionally called meetings of his supporters in Parliament over the previous four years, there is no evidence to suggest he had any say in the nomination of candidates', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 72.
    
    At the 1876 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Forrest government were more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent' in the table above (see see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p. 74). Campaigning was undertaken by various trade union groups which would form the basis for the Labor Party at future elections; see generally, H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 341-387, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035); pp 318-321 provide commentary on the 1897 election.
    
    At the 1901 election, groupings of candidates supporting or opposing the Throssell government and its policies were becoming more clearly defined, leading to the categorizations of successful candidates as 'Ministerialist', 'Opposition', and 'Independent', in the table above, although '... many candidates had only the loosest connection with either the Ministerialist or the Opposition group', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 569. The success of candidates affiliated with the labour movement was to hasten the development of modern partisan politics; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    At the 1904 election, politics began to be polarized between Ministerialist candidates, some of whom ran as 'Liberals', and those affiliated with the labour movement; those candidates who ran as Liberals '... were supported by the National Political League formed in March 1904', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570. For the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    The 1905 election '... completed the trend towards a two-party Assembly which James [the previous Ministerialist Premier] had encouraged the year before. The Independents all either lost their seats or were driven into the arms of the Ministerialists, who won 35 of the 50 seats .... As was occurring elsewhere in Australia at about the same time, parliamentary politics became permanently established as a conflict between Labor and non-Labor, in preference to other possible patterns', Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for the emergence of political parties in Western Australia, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).
    
    By the 1908 election, the success of the Labor Party had had the effect of encouraging the creation of a single non-Labor grouping. 'Although the term 'Liberal Party' did not come into general use until 1911 ... there were two "clearly opposed and fairly evenly balanced political parties" [reference to Hyams, see below]. Virtually every member of the Legislative Assembly was either described as Ministerialist or Labor. The degree of non-Labor unity within parliament was not immediately paralleled by the formation of an integrated extra-parliamentary organization ...', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 192 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    For a detailed study of non-Labor politics in this period, see Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354, at pp 346-354 (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035), and note B K Hyams, 'Western Australian Political Parties, 1901-1916', University Studies in History and Economics, [University of Western Australia], 2(3), September 1955: 48-61.
    
    'At the 1911 election, the Ministerialists campaigned for the first time as the Liberal party, bringing them into conformity with the federal party and the [Liberal] League', Brian de Garis, 'Western Australia', in P Loveday, A W Martin and R S Parker (editors), The Emergence of the Australian Party System, pp 298-354, at p. 354, (Sydney: Hale & Iremonger, 1977, ISBN 0908094035).

    Liberals for Forests: At the 2001 Election Janet Woollard was elected to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2001, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2001 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2001, ISBN 0730761010), also online at : http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010]). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    
    Labor candidates: 
    
    The 1901 election is the first election for the Legislative Assembly at which candidates were elected who was affiliated to the labour movement. The votes for these candidates are shown as being votes for the Australian Labor Party even though such an organization had not yet been formed. Several bodies competed to represent the labour movement; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94, p.82); and H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).
    
    Candidates affiliated with labour organizations contested 33 electoral districts at the 1904 election and won 22 seats, more than any other party grouping. The party was able to gain enough parliamentary support after the election to replace the James Ministerialist government with a minority Australian Labor Party government; see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: p.88; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In the 1905 Election,'Labor was caught ill-prepared and its representation shrank to 15, but the establishment of a clear two-party system of which it was the most sharply defined member, was certainly to its long-term advantage', see Brian de Garis, 'Self-Government and the Emergence of Political Parties, 1890-1911', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 63-95, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839), and note C T Stannage, 'The Composition of the Western Australian Parliament 1890-1911', University Studies in History, 4 (3), 1965: 85-94; for a study of the growth of the Labor Party in Western Australia, see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392), and note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    The split in the Australian Labor Party over the issue of conscription in 1916 had led to a number of its Assembly members defecting to form a National Labor as part of the Nationalist Coalition government which supported conscription; see H J Gibney, 'Western Australia', in D J Murphy (editor), Labor in Politics: The State Labor Parties in Australia 1880-1920, pp 343-385, at pp. 369-373, (St Lucia, Qld: University of Queensland Press, 1975, ISBN 0702209392).

    At the 1921 election, the Australian Labor Party regained some of its electoral support, much of this being at the expense of National Labor Party members who continued to support the Nationalist Coalition government.

    Democratic Labor Party: The Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement suffered major internal divisions in the 1950s which came to a head in 1955 with a split in some state branches of the Party and the creation of what was to become the Democratic Labor Party; for an extensive study of this period, see Robert Murray, The Split: Australian Labor in the Fifties, (Melbourne: Cheshire, 1972, ISBN 0701516755). For the formation of the party in Western Australia and its continuing effect on Labor politics into the 1970s, note Ralph Pervan and Douglas Mitchell, 'The Changing Nature of the Australian Labor Party', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 129-158, at pp 140-143 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and see F K Crowley, State Election:The Fall of the Hawke Government, A Brief Account, (Perth: published by the author, 1959). 
    Democratic Party: This party fielded five candidates at this election. It was formed in 1968 and favoured a free enterprise system, opposition to government funding of non-government schools, and a range of other policies; see Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, p.82 (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217) [Jaensch and Mathieson refer to this party as 'Democratic Party (3)' to distinguish it from other parties with the same name].?
    Independents: 'During the term of the Leake ministry (1901 to 1904), the Government and Opposition drew closer together; by the 1904 election the old Forrest 'Conservative' group had become 'Independents' in name', Colin A Hughes and B D Graham, A Handbook of Australian Government and Politics 1890-1964, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1968, SBN 708102700), p. 570.
    
    The Independent member elected at the 1993 election was Elizabeth Constable, who retained the seat of Floreat which she had won in a by-election as an Independent in 1991; Constable viewed herself as an Independent Liberal having originally run for election as the consequence of a factional dispute over candidate endorsement within the Liberal Party.
    
    The three Independents elected at the 1996 election were Ernest Bridge (Kimberley) who had defected from the Australian Labor Party in 1995 after having been the Labor member for Kimberley since 1977; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) who regarded herself as an Independent Liberal since the time of her first entry to the Assembly in a by-election in 1991; and Phillip Pendal (South Perth), who had been elected to the Assembly at the previous election (1993) as a member of the Liberal Party, and sat after this election (1996) as an Independent Liberal.
    
    The vote shown for Independents at this election (2001) is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (54) and those candidates who ran for office without any registered party name (5), a total of 59 such candidates.
    
    Three of the Independent candidates were elected in the 2001 Election, (four if the Liberals for Forests candidate Woolard is included; see Liberals for Forests). Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Phillip Pendal (South Perth) were re-elected as Independents (sitting as Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Larry Graham, who had been denied endorsement by the Labor Party for the seat of Pilbara, ran as an Independent candidate and won the seat.
    
    The vote shown for independents at the 2005 election is the sum of votes cast for all candidates registered as Independents (39) and two candidates who ran for office without any registered party name, a total of 41 such candidates.
    
    Two of the Independent candidates were elected; Elizabeth Constable (Churchlands) and Janet Woollard (Alfred Cove) were re-elected. Constable sat as an Independent Liberals in the Assembly). Woollard, in spite of being being elected under the banner of the unregistered Liberals for Forests party in 2001, and this party label being registered as a political party in 2005, ran as an Independent at this election (2005); see Antony Green, Western Australian State Election 2005, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, Election Paper Series 2/2005 (Perth, Western Australian Parliamentary Library, 2006, ISBN 1920886664); also online at: http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/web/newwebparl.nsf/iframewebpages/Library+Publications [accessed 8 August 2010].

    Australia Party: This party emerged as a group to reform the federal Liberal Party in 1966; while its primary focus was on national politics, it fielded candidates at various state elections in all mainland states between 1971 and 1979; see Keith Richmond, 'Minor Parties in Australia', in Graeme Starr, Keith Richmond and Graham Maddox (editors), Political Parties in Australia, pp 317-384, at 344-351, and note Dean Jaensch and David Mathieson, A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia, pp 32-33, (St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin, 1998, ISBN 1864484217). The party fielded one candidate at this Assembly election (1971).

    The Liberal Party was also affected by the issue of conscription and the First World War; some of its Assembly members saw themselves as being affiliated with such newly formed Nationalist organizations as the National League, while others campaigned as Liberals who were part of the Nationalist Coalition government; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 197-198 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In this database, former Liberal candidates who campaigned with the support of the National League are referred to as affiliated with the Nationalist Party even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).

    Liberal Party and Liberal and Country League: In 1949, a public meeting '... attended by several hundred people from various parts of the state approved the formation of the Liberal and Country League (LCL) .... The Liberal Party agreed to submerge its identity in the new party...' David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p.218 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Black argues that this change of name was part of a continuing struggle between the Liberal Party and the Country Party; see David Black, 'The Liberals Triumphant: The Politics of Development 1947-1980', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 441-470, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819). 
    Liberals for Forests: Janet Woollard was elected  at the 2001 Election to the seat of Alfred Cover as one of eight Liberals for Forests candidates even though this label was not a registered party name (see Green in 'Sources', below details). A comprehensive study of this party can be found in Amanda Blackburn and Bruce Stone, 'The Environment and Minor-party Insurgency in Australian Politics: The Case of Logging and the "liberals for forests"', Australian Journal of Political Science, 38 (3) November 2003: 493-509.
    Country Party: 'The decision of the FSA [Western Australian Farmers and Settlers Association] to form a third political party was taken in 1913 and grew out of the belief among farmers that their interests were neglected by both the existing parties, Labor and Liberal', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 159 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495); for a survey and analysis of the rise of country parties across Australia, see B D Graham, The Formation of the Australian Country Parties, (Canberra: Australian National University Press, 1966).
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Under Premier Mitchell, the Country Party members became increasingly dissatisfied with the conduct of the Nationalist Coalition government but '... the party had not yet found a formula enabling it to combine its independent identity with its membership of coalition government', Layman, p. 164.
    
    'In May 1917, the Country Party joined with the Liberal Party and the National Labor Party to form the National [Nationalist] Party, with each party maintaining its separate identity but joining to form a coalition government', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p. 164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Some candidates affiliated with the Country Party chose to run without any commitment to the National Coalition government.
    
    Tensions within the Country Party over its role in the National Coalition government of Premier Mitchell led to strains between the Primary Producers Association (PPA) and Country Party members of parliament. In 1923, these disagreements came to a head with the executive of the PPA refusing to endorse several sitting Country Party members. As a consequence, the Party split between those who supported continued close cooperation between Country Party members and the National Coalition (the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party), and those who wished Country Party members to follow a more independent line (the Executive Country Party). Both these groups fielded candidates at this Legislative Assembly election (1924).
    
    For details of this Country Party split, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819), p. 105.
    
    The creation of the United Party meant that there was only one group which claimed the name Country Party for this Legislative Assembly election (1927); on the Country Party during this period, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 163-164 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    The Country Party had suffered a major split in 1923 but had undergone a major reorganization to rebuild its electoral base and parliamentary support in the years leading up to the 1930 election. Its defeat at the 1936 election condemned it to another stint on the opposition benches see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 164-167 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    At the 1944 conference of the Primary Producers Association (PPA), a motion was passed which terminated the administrative arrangements through which the Country Party had been the political wing of the PPA. Its newly acquired political autonomy required the party to create its own organization and source of funds. As part of this reorganization, the party changed its name to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at pp 167-170 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Country Party and Country and Democratic League: The Country Party had changed its name in 1944 to the Country and Democratic League as a sign of the party's intention to widen its electoral appeal; the parliamentary party -- but not the organization -- reverted to the name Country Party in 1949. But the party faced strong competition from the Liberals and lost three seats at this election (1950); see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    After the electoral changes of 1947, demographic trends and competition from the Liberals, the Democratic League struggled to maintain its representation; see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495.

    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see Lenore Layman, 'Continuity and Change 1947-1965', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 153-183, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    National Alliance and Country Party: In the face of dwindling electoral support and vigorous competition from the Liberal Party, the Country Party merged with the Democratic Labor Party to form the National Alliance '... an unlikely union given the very different social roots and political concerns of the two', Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.183 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). Not all Country Party parliamentary members joined the new party, and some candidates had joint endorsement for both the Country Party and the National Alliance, three members were elected with National Alliance endorsement (H J Cowan, A V Crane, and W P McPharlin), two with joint endorsement from the Country Party and National Alliance (R C Old and P Jones), and one with endorsement from the Country Party alone (M E Stephens).
    
    The poor performance of the fused party led the Country Party to revert to its previous name and organization after the 1974 election; support for the Democratic Labor Party had collapsed after the election of the Whitlam Australian Labor Party government in Canberra in 1972. 
    National Country Party and Country Party: In response to tensions within the party, and in a further attempt to redefine its role and broaden its electoral appeal, the Country Party changed its name in 1975 to the National Country Party; for context and analysis, see Lenore Layman, 'The Country Party: Rise and Decline', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 159-190, at p.184 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084)
    A split within the National Country Party in 1978 led to '... the existence of two parties: the larger and more conservative National Country Party (NCP), the Liberals' coalition partner, and the smaller, more radical National Party (NP) playing a cross-bench role. The 1978 split was the culmination of a period of uncertainty as the party tried a number of strategies to arrest electoral decline', Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at p. 109 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084).
    As foreshadowed by Geoff Gallop and Lenore Layman, 'Western Australia', in Brian Costar and Dennis Woodward (editors), Country to National: Australian Rural Politics and Beyond, pp 109-118, at pp 116-118 (North Sydney: George Allen & Unwin, 1985, ISBN 0868617084) the parties started a process of reunification in 1984 which was completed by 1986 under the name of the National Party of Australia (in this database the name National Party is used for the reunited party to simplify comparisons with other states and to conform to common usage). Not all parliamentary members of the National Country Party accepted the terms for reunion; for brief a comment on the consequences of reuniting the party, see Harry Phillips, 'The Modern Parliament, 1965-1989', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 185-262, at pp 226-246, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839) p. 232.
    
    United Party: The split in the Country Party in 1923 led to the existence of two Country parties, the Executive Country Party, and the Majority (or Ministerial) Country Party. The Majority Country Party, '... after an unsuccessful attempt to form their own Independent Country Party, joined with the National League [Nationalist Party] and the remnants of the National Labor Party to form the United Party', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 202 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). At the election, individual candidates campaigning under the banner of the United Party maintained their links to Nationalist or Country Party organizations.?
    Nationalist Coalition The realignment of parties in 1916-1917 led to the creation of a Nationalist Coalition comprising all non-Labor groupings .The Nationalist Coalition had features of both a coalition and a political party and is treated as a single partisan affiliation for the governments of Western Australia between 1917 and 1924. The component groupings maintained their separate identities and became increasingly autonomous after 1917.
    
    The Nationalist Party and the Nationalist Coalition government had been formed as part of the realignment political support that had been prompted by the conscription crisis and the First World War. The Nationalist Party had absorbed most of the support of the Liberal Party but had only a fragmented organization and its relationship with the Liberal League was unclear. Members elected as Nationalists were dominant in the Nationalist Coalition government of Mitchell  (1921 to 1924); see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at p. 98 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and see 'References', below .
    
    With the defeat of the Nationalist Coalition government at the 1924 election the coalition disbanded, and its constituent parties operated as independent entities.
    
    The Nationalist Party (Nationalists) was the successor to the Liberal Party which had existed before the First World War, but its support was heavily concentrated in the electoral districts of metropolitan Perth; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 201-204 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495), and For the political context of this election (1924), see David Black, 'Party Politics in Turmoil, 1911-1924', in C T Stannage (editor), A New History of Western Australia, pp 381-405, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1981, ISBN 0855641819).
    
    For an overview of the context of Western Australian parliamentary and electoral politics in this period, see David Black, 'Factionalism and Stability, 1911-1947', in David Black (editor), The House on the Hill: A History of the Parliament of Western Australia 1832-1990, pp 97-151, (Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project, Parliament of Western Australia, 1991, ISBN 0730939839).
    
    The formation of the United Party meant that members of the Nationalist Party ran as United Party candidates. In this database, then party name Nationalist Party (Nationalists) is used even though some references -- and contemporary commentary -- referred to the party in Western Australia as the National Party; the use of the label 'Nationalist' is used to distinguish the party from the National Party which emerged in the 1970s.
    
    The restructuring of the Country Party contrasted with the weak organization of the Nationalist Party during this period and growing tensions within the party over the secession movement in Western Australia. But this did not prevent the party's success at the 1930 election and its ability to be the dominant partner in the governing coalition; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 204-206, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    The defeat at the 1933 election exacerbated the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    
    In 1931, the federal Parliamentary Labor Party in Canberra split over Depression finance policies, and some members of Labor Party joined with the Nationalist Party to form the United Australia Party under the leadership of Joseph Lyons (see generally, Clem Lloyd, 'The Rise and Fall of the United Australia Party', in J R Nethercote (editor), Liberalism and the Australian Federation pp 113-133, (Sydney: Federation Press, 2001, ISBN 1862874026). The political context of Western Australian politics did not lead to the creation of a WA branch of the United Australia Party; the Nationalist Party retained its name but cooperated with the federal party at federal elections. 
    The defeat at the 1936 election continued the Nationalists' electoral and organizational problems; see David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 206-211, (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495).
    Delegates from the Western Australian Nationalist Party had attended a national conference of anti-socialist organizations held in Albury late in 1944 which had decided on the formation of a new Liberal Party of Australia to replace the patchwork of anti-Labor groups across Australia. The new party would be based on shared principles but its organization would rely on largely autonomous state branches. The party would have a broadly based membership, and be responsible for raising its own funds. A Western Australian branch of the new Liberal Party was established in 1945; 'Despite the difficulty of shaking off its image as an oligarchical, predominantly metropolitan party, the Liberal Party gradually became something more than the old National[ist] Party renamed', David Black, 'The Liberal Party and its Predecessors', in Ralph Pervan and Campbell Sharman (editors), Essays on Western Australian Politics, pp 191-232, at pp 212 (Perth: University of Western Australia Press, 1979, ISBN 0855641495). 
    Independent Nationalist: The only Independent Nationalist candidate was Harry Shearn who won the seat of Maylands at this election without a contest (he had held the seat without any party endorsement since 1936); no party nominated a candidate to run against him at the 1947 election.?
    Women's Electoral League: The votes for this party grouping were all cast for Edith Cowan who ran as a candidate for the League in the electoral district of East Perth. Edith Cowan was the first woman elected to any Australian parliament; she had won the seat of Perth West as a Nationalist Candidate for the Legislative Assembly in 1921, but was defeated (by a rival Nationalist Party candidate) at the 1924 election.

    In light of the current drug policy which acts to deter drug use through law enforcement, the study was undertaken to investigate whether the threat of legal punishment has any influence on marijuana use by high school aged students.  Using a proven theoretical model, influence was measured both in terms of direct deterrence (e.g. through perceptions of arrest risk and fear of punishment) and indirect deterrence (e.g. physical and material cost of complying or not complying with the law; moral commitment to the law; and informal sanctions imposed by peers, family, or other significant members of the potential user's social network).  Emphasis,however, was placed on the former  in order to evaluate the effectiveness  of law enforcement on drug use and hence its worth as a method of drug control.
    
    Respondents were asked questions on their use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, pain relievers, sedatives, narcotics (e.g. heroin) and other recreational drugs (e.g. stimulants, hallucinogens);  the number of times they  and/or members of their family had been caught for marijuana possession; the consequences of that arrest;  ease, and financial cost, of obtaining marijuana;  their perceived risk of being caught for marijuana possession and/or use; their personal view of those who use marijuana and the health risks associated with usage; and the effect the opinions of others has on their own use of marijuana. 
    
    Background variables include age, sex, parents country of birth, language spoken at home, household composition, and whether the respodent is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.

    Summary details for each election year for the Australian States Lower Houses. It includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    Assembly  - In this database, the term 'assembly' is used to refer to the lower house of all state and territory parliaments even though their official names vary slightly. These lower houses are the chambers in which the government must retain a majority to remain in office. Assemblies are the critical components of parliamentary government and are the basis for broad based popular representation in the governmental process. In South Australia and Tasmania the chamber is called the House of Assembly, but in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, it is called the Legislative Assembly. The lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament is called the House of Representatives.
    
    The parliaments of the two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, have been unicameral since their establishment. In both territories the single chamber is called the Legislative Assembly and performs the same function as the lower house in state parliaments.
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the Legislative Council and being elected (or nominated) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral (Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922) and these chambers have been reformed so that they have the same franchise as the lower house and is an important component of the law making process. This database does not yet contain information on all state upper houses. The Senate is the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament and information on Senate elections is contained in this database. 
    At large election - An election held 'at large' is one in which the whole body of voters vote as one electoral district for all the candidates to be elected. At large elections are usually associated with electoral systems using proportional representation; see also multimember district, single member district.
    
    Only two at large general elections have been held for the lower house of an Australian parliament during the period covered in this database -- the elections of 1989 and 1992 for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.
    
    Ballots - a vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    Bicameralism - A bicameral parliament is one which has two chambers, a lower house and an upper house (see assembly).
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the legislative council and being elected (or nominated in the case of New South Wales and Queensland) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral; Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922 and several attempts were made to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council until it became a directly elected chamber in 1978.
    
    Change from previous election (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    Colony - The six largely self-governing political communities which had grown from British settlement of Australia after 1788 were called colonies -- New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia. When the six colonies joined in a federal union in 1901, their political institutions were unchanged and most of their law making powers remained intact but, as components of a federation, their name was changed from colony to state. For the sake of simplicity, the term state is used in this database to include the period before 1901 when the term 'colony' or 'colonial' would be the technically correct term. 
    Contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral district - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear.
    
    Electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law.
    
    
    First past the post - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    Franchise - The franchise refers to those who are eligible to vote at elections. In Australia, the franchise is now universal for all Australian citizens over 18 years of age (often referred to as universal suffrage) although, even with universal franchise, there may be some who are disqualified from voting for such reasons as serving a sentence for a criminal offense or having been declared of unsound mind. There may also be residency requirements before a person can vote in a particular electoral district.
    
    In the past, the franchise has been restricted in a variety of ways. At the beginning of the period covered in this database, ownership of property was required to vote at some elections, and most women were disenfranchised; this was often the case for those eligible to vote for upper houses in the period after the granting of responsible government in 1856. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not have full voting rights in Commonwealth and some state elections until the 1960s.
    Hare-Clark system - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    Informal (invalid) vote - In this database, an informal vote is one which does not follow the electoral rules required for the vote to be counted as a valid vote. The term informal vote can also refer to the total number of informal votes cast at an election. The sum of the total valid votes and the total informal vote will be the total of votes cast at the election. The rate of informal voting is calculated by expressing the informal vote as a percentage of the total votes cast at an election. 
    Multimember district - A multimember electoral district is one which returns more than one member to a representative assembly (see single member district). Multimember districts can be combined with first past the post electoral systems and with preferential voting, but are now usually used as part of systems of proportional representation.
    
    Multiple voting - In this database multiple voting refers to electoral systems which permit (or require) a voter to cast more than one vote on a ballot paper to elect more than one member from a multimember electoral district using first past the post (plurality) voting. It can also refer to electoral systems which permit a voter to cast more than one ballot to elect more than one member from an electoral district; see also informal ballots multiple votes.
    
    Multiple voting should be distinguished from plural voting which permits a voter to vote in more than one electoral district. 
    Optional preferences - In this database, if a voter under a system of preferential voting must vote for only one candidate, but may rank more than one candidate listed on the ballot paper, this is referred to as preferential voting with optional preferences. 
    Proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    
    The following two kinds of proportional representation have been used to elect members of parliament in Australia.
    
    Proportional representation by party list (PR-List) - Party-based variants of proportional representation require the voter to choose between lists of party candidates rather individual candidates. A wide variety of these PR-List systems (some of which provide a limited choice of candidates) have been used in Europe.
    
    A list system of proportional representation was used for South Australian Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981, and a modified d'Hondt list system was used for the first two elections for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989 and 1992.
    
    Proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (PR-STV) - The major candidate-based system of proportional representation is proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV). This has been the most common form of proportional representation adopted in Australia.
    
    It requires a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates running for election in the order of the voters' choice. The preferences are counted using a quota to calculate the successful candidates. There are several ways in which the quota can be calculated and a variety of ways of transfering preferences between candidates. Note that the adoption of 'above the line' voting for PR-STV systems used by Australian upper houses has reduced the significance the voter's ability to rank individual candidates (see below).
    
    After a trial for the city electoral districts of Hobart and Launceston in 1897 and 1900, proportional representation by STV has been used since 1909 for elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament, where it is often called the Hare-Clark system. It has also been used for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory for elections since 1995, and is used as the basis for representation in the Commonwealth Senate since 1949, and the legislative councils of New South Wales, South Australian, Victoria and Western Australia.
    Registration of voters - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). Compulsory enrolment was introduced for Australian lower house elections over the period between 1911 and 1930.
    
    Single member district - The term single member district is used to indicate that a member of parliament is the only representative elected from an electoral district. This is in contrast with multimember districts where several members are elected from a single district. The lower houses of all Australian parliaments except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory now use single member districts, but a mixture of single and multimember districts was common in nineteenth and early twentieth century parliaments. The members of a parliamentary chamber can also be elected from a single state wide electoral district (see at large election). This system is currently used for the election of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council.
    
    The choice of single member districts as the basis for representation for a parliamentary chamber is a major part of the electoral system and usually has the effect of favouring the representation of large parties. In political science, single member districts are said to have a district magnitude of one. A district magnitude of more than one is needed for proportional representation. 
    State - The Australian federation is composed of six states; New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The states have extensive law making powers and responsibility for the administration of most public services. Until federation in 1901, the states were largely self-governing colonies. This database contains information on parties, elections, governments and representation of all states since 1890 (New South Wales since 1856).
    
    There have been no new states added to the federation since 1901 but two self-governing territories of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have been created and now operate for many purposes as if they were states. They lack, however, constitutional guarantees for their governments and their law making power, and the same representation in the Senate as the original states. 
    
    Turnout - The turnout at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Uncontested seats - the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.

    Summary details for each election year for the Australian States Lower Houses. It includes electoral system characteristics, seats in chamber, number of enrolled voters, ballots cast, rate of voter turnout and rate of informal voting.
    
    Definitions of  variables :
    
    Assembly  - In this database, the term 'assembly' is used to refer to the lower house of all state and territory parliaments even though their official names vary slightly. These lower houses are the chambers in which the government must retain a majority to remain in office. Assemblies are the critical components of parliamentary government and are the basis for broad based popular representation in the governmental process. In South Australia and Tasmania the chamber is called the House of Assembly, but in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia, it is called the Legislative Assembly. The lower house of the Commonwealth Parliament is called the House of Representatives.
    
    The parliaments of the two self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, have been unicameral since their establishment. In both territories the single chamber is called the Legislative Assembly and performs the same function as the lower house in state parliaments.
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the Legislative Council and being elected (or nominated) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral (Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922) and these chambers have been reformed so that they have the same franchise as the lower house and is an important component of the law making process. This database does not yet contain information on all state upper houses. The Senate is the upper house of the Commonwealth Parliament and information on Senate elections is contained in this database. 
    At large election - An election held 'at large' is one in which the whole body of voters vote as one electoral district for all the candidates to be elected. At large elections are usually associated with electoral systems using proportional representation; see also multimember district, single member district.
    
    Only two at large general elections have been held for the lower house of an Australian parliament during the period covered in this database -- the elections of 1989 and 1992 for the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly.
    
    Ballots - a vote can be a single mark, or one or more marks or numbers to elect one or more candidates. At some elections, voters could mark ballots with more than one vote, giving the result that there were more votes cast than voters. This was the case for elections for the South Australian House of Assembly until 1927.
    
    Bicameralism - A bicameral parliament is one which has two chambers, a lower house and an upper house (see assembly).
    
    All state (formerly colonial) parliaments had two chambers when the Australian colonies gained self-government in the late 1850s (Western Australia in 1890), the upper house being called the legislative council and being elected (or nominated in the case of New South Wales and Queensland) from a restricted section of the community. All states except Queensland remain bicameral; Queensland abolished its upper house in 1922 and several attempts were made to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council until it became a directly elected chamber in 1978.
    
    Change from previous election (Swing) The change in first preference vote won by a party at a given election when compared with the previous election, expressed as the difference between the percentage first preference vote shares. Note that the party must be listed in the database for both elections (see listed party) for a figure to appear in the column. If the party was a listed party in the previous election but ran candidates under a difference name, no figure for changed vote share will appear (see party name).
    
    Colony - The six largely self-governing political communities which had grown from British settlement of Australia after 1788 were called colonies -- New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia. When the six colonies joined in a federal union in 1901, their political institutions were unchanged and most of their law making powers remained intact but, as components of a federation, their name was changed from colony to state. For the sake of simplicity, the term state is used in this database to include the period before 1901 when the term 'colony' or 'colonial' would be the technically correct term. 
    Contingent voting - This can be thought of as a form of preferential voting (AV) with compulsory or optional preferences which permits the voter to vote for one or two candidates, but no more than two, by indicating a first choice candidate and, if the voter wishes, a second choice candidate. If a candidate gains more than 50 percent of the first preference votes cast in an electoral district, he or she is declared elected. If there is no such candidate, the second preferences shown on the ballot papers of all but the two candidates with the most first preference votes are divided between the top two candidates. After this assignment, the candidate with the most votes is declared the winner.
    
    This system has been used in general elections for the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1893 until 1941 (in single and multimember districts until 1909), and for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1928. It was also used for the first direct election of the Mayor of London in 2000 where it was called supplementary voting.
    
    For a discussion of contingent voting, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 25, 52-54 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    
    Electoral district - Electoral districts are also called electorates but, as the term electorate also refers to the whole body of voters across a political system, the term electoral district has been used in this database to keep the distinction clear.
    
    Electoral roll - The electoral roll is the list of voters who are registered to vote at an election. 
    
    Electoral system - The electoral system is the set of rules which specifies how elections are organized and how votes are cast and counted at an election. The broad category of electoral system used to elect members at an election is shown in the database, and the entries are indexed in this database under the name of each electoral system.
    
    Australia has been adventurous in its experimentation with electoral rules and electoral law.
    
    
    First past the post - A first past the post electoral system is one in which a voter is required to mark the ballot paper, usually with a cross or tick, indicating the voter's preferred candidate. The winning candidate is the one with the most votes. In electoral contests where there are only two candidates, the candidate with the most votes will have a majority (that is, more than 50 percent of the votes cast). If there are more than two candidates, the candidate with the most votes may only have a plurality (that is, more than any other candidate, but less that 50 percent of the votes cast). For this reason, first past the post voting is sometimes called plurality voting and is indicated in this database as 'first past the post (plurality) voting'.
    
    First past the post electoral systems were widely used in Australia until the rise of the Australian Labor Party prompted anti-Labor parties after 1910 to adopt preferential voting for most lower house elections in Australia.
    
    First past the post electoral systems are usually associated with single member districts, but they can also be used in multimember districts. The use of plurality voting with multimember districts is often called 'block voting'; the voter is given as many votes as there are candidates to be elected from the district. Such a system favours well organized party tickets and a successful party can win all the seats in a multimember district with a plurality of votes. This system was used for the Commonwealth Senate until 1919.
    
    Plurality voting can also be used in multimember districts by giving the voters as many ballots as there are candidates to be elected from the district. This enables voters to vote for several candidates or to cast more than one ballot for their favoured candidate (see also ballots). 
    Franchise - The franchise refers to those who are eligible to vote at elections. In Australia, the franchise is now universal for all Australian citizens over 18 years of age (often referred to as universal suffrage) although, even with universal franchise, there may be some who are disqualified from voting for such reasons as serving a sentence for a criminal offense or having been declared of unsound mind. There may also be residency requirements before a person can vote in a particular electoral district.
    
    In the past, the franchise has been restricted in a variety of ways. At the beginning of the period covered in this database, ownership of property was required to vote at some elections, and most women were disenfranchised; this was often the case for those eligible to vote for upper houses in the period after the granting of responsible government in 1856. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples did not have full voting rights in Commonwealth and some state elections until the 1960s.
    Hare-Clark system - The Hare-Clark system is a form of proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV) used to elect members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 1909. For a brief summary of the Hare-Clark system and its context, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 26-27 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). 
    Informal (invalid) vote - In this database, an informal vote is one which does not follow the electoral rules required for the vote to be counted as a valid vote. The term informal vote can also refer to the total number of informal votes cast at an election. The sum of the total valid votes and the total informal vote will be the total of votes cast at the election. The rate of informal voting is calculated by expressing the informal vote as a percentage of the total votes cast at an election. 
    Multimember district - A multimember electoral district is one which returns more than one member to a representative assembly (see single member district). Multimember districts can be combined with first past the post electoral systems and with preferential voting, but are now usually used as part of systems of proportional representation.
    
    Multiple voting - In this database multiple voting refers to electoral systems which permit (or require) a voter to cast more than one vote on a ballot paper to elect more than one member from a multimember electoral district using first past the post (plurality) voting. It can also refer to electoral systems which permit a voter to cast more than one ballot to elect more than one member from an electoral district; see also informal ballots multiple votes.
    
    Multiple voting should be distinguished from plural voting which permits a voter to vote in more than one electoral district. 
    Optional preferences - In this database, if a voter under a system of preferential voting must vote for only one candidate, but may rank more than one candidate listed on the ballot paper, this is referred to as preferential voting with optional preferences. 
    Proportional representation - Proportional representation refers to any electoral system which aims to create a representative parliamentary chamber in which the proportion of seats in the assembly matches the pattern of votes cast at an election. Proportional representation can be based on the proportional representation of parties or on the representation of candidates according to their support in terms of preferences expressed by the voters.
    
    All systems of proportional representation require elections to be held in multimember districts and the larger the number of members in each electoral district (district magnitude), the more proportional the result. This means that the higher the district magnitude, the easier it is for small parties to be represented in a parliamentary chamber. In this respect, proportional representation is an electoral system which is likely to encourage diversity of representation.
    
    The following two kinds of proportional representation have been used to elect members of parliament in Australia.
    
    Proportional representation by party list (PR-List) - Party-based variants of proportional representation require the voter to choose between lists of party candidates rather individual candidates. A wide variety of these PR-List systems (some of which provide a limited choice of candidates) have been used in Europe.
    
    A list system of proportional representation was used for South Australian Legislative Council from 1973 to 1981, and a modified d'Hondt list system was used for the first two elections for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory in 1989 and 1992.
    
    Proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (PR-STV) - The major candidate-based system of proportional representation is proportional representation by the single transferable vote method (STV). This has been the most common form of proportional representation adopted in Australia.
    
    It requires a preferential voting system where voters rank the candidates running for election in the order of the voters' choice. The preferences are counted using a quota to calculate the successful candidates. There are several ways in which the quota can be calculated and a variety of ways of transfering preferences between candidates. Note that the adoption of 'above the line' voting for PR-STV systems used by Australian upper houses has reduced the significance the voter's ability to rank individual candidates (see below).
    
    After a trial for the city electoral districts of Hobart and Launceston in 1897 and 1900, proportional representation by STV has been used since 1909 for elections for the Tasmanian House of Assembly, the lower house of the Tasmanian Parliament, where it is often called the Hare-Clark system. It has also been used for the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory for elections since 1995, and is used as the basis for representation in the Commonwealth Senate since 1949, and the legislative councils of New South Wales, South Australian, Victoria and Western Australia.
    Registration of voters - Registration (enrolment) as a voter is now compulsory for all Australian parliamentary elections (note the partial exception of South Australia, below). With minor qualifications for length of residence and variations for some state and territory elections, all eligible Australian citizens are required to be registered as voters. Comprehensive voter registration can be achieved by surveying households, and by requiring state agencies which compile lists of names and addresses to provided these lists to electoral authorities. 
    
    For commentary on the context of compulsory registration, see David M Farrell and Ian McAllister, The Australian Electoral System: Origins, Variations and Consequences, pp 121-124 (Sydney: University of New South Wales Press, 2006, ISBN 0868408581). Compulsory enrolment was introduced for Australian lower house elections over the period between 1911 and 1930.
    
    Single member district - The term single member district is used to indicate that a member of parliament is the only representative elected from an electoral district. This is in contrast with multimember districts where several members are elected from a single district. The lower houses of all Australian parliaments except Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory now use single member districts, but a mixture of single and multimember districts was common in nineteenth and early twentieth century parliaments. The members of a parliamentary chamber can also be elected from a single state wide electoral district (see at large election). This system is currently used for the election of members of the Western Australian Legislative Council.
    
    The choice of single member districts as the basis for representation for a parliamentary chamber is a major part of the electoral system and usually has the effect of favouring the representation of large parties. In political science, single member districts are said to have a district magnitude of one. A district magnitude of more than one is needed for proportional representation. 
    State - The Australian federation is composed of six states; New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The states have extensive law making powers and responsibility for the administration of most public services. Until federation in 1901, the states were largely self-governing colonies. This database contains information on parties, elections, governments and representation of all states since 1890 (New South Wales since 1856).
    
    There have been no new states added to the federation since 1901 but two self-governing territories of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have been created and now operate for many purposes as if they were states. They lack, however, constitutional guarantees for their governments and their law making power, and the same representation in the Senate as the original states. 
    
    Turnout - The turnout at election is the proportion of voters on the electoral roll (registered voters) who cast a vote. In this database, turnout is measured as the rate of voting in contested seats, shown as a percentage of registered voters. 
    
    Uncontested seats - the number of seats in which only one candidate ran for office, and won the seat without any votes having to be cast. Although there have been very few uncontested seats at general elections in Australia since 1980, they were a regular feature of elections in some states until the 1960s. The frequency of uncontested seats and the number of enrolled voters they contain can be a useful indicator of the competitiveness of the party system at a general election. For more information and analysis, see Campbell Sharman, 'Uncontested Seats and the Evolution of Party Competition: The Australian Case', Party Politics, 9(6) November 2003: 679-702.

    The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the Employment Initiatives Program (EIP) in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects. The Program was a short-term job creation scheme set up by the Victorian Government in 1982.
    
    File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.
    
    File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.
    
    File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 
    
    Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.
    
    File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent's general impressions about the EIP job creation program.
    
    Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.
    
    The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.
    
    The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.

    The Australian Values Study was undertaken as part of a major international survey to compare fundamental values in different countries throughout the world. It focuses on such areas as attitudes towards work, life satisfaction, family, political, moral, religious and spiritual values, and a wide range of social issues. The study was conducted in two parts. The first stage was a personal interview questionnaire, administered by an interviewer. The data for this stage has been previously documented as 'Australian Values Study Survey, 1983' (SSDA Study No. 375). The second stage was a questionnaire left by the interviewer, to be completed by the respondent and mailed back.
    
    Topics covered in the mail-back questionnaire include newspaper and magazine readership; television watching and radio listening; parental attitudes; family costs; division of labour in the household; personal experiences in the previous year; opinions on current social issues such as invitro fertilisation, nuclear arms, terrorism, conditions for aborigines in Australia; views on economic development and growth in Australia, government intervention in business, jobs and trade unions; perceptions of individual companies, changes in the respondent's own attitudes and opinions; details of food and beverages usually consumed, types of cigarettes and cigars smoked; personal finance, investment and credit card usage; insurance and superannuation; and makes and models of automobiles purchased or preferred. Background variables include age, sex, birthplace, nationality, languages, level of education, employment status, approximate income, occupation, details of main income earner, household pets, home ownership, type of dwelling and size of town.

    The Australian National Social Science Survey is a major multi-purpose survey measuring a wide range of variables of interest in sociology, political science and labour economics. It is similar to national social surveys conducted regularly in the U.S.A., Britain and West Germany. Much of the data in the Australian survey are directly comparable with these other surveys. The data are representative of the non-institutionalised population aged 18 years and over, capable of being interviewed in English, in all States and Territories of Australia.
    
    The questionnaire covers attitudes toward how much money is spent on foreign aid, defence, unemployment, medical and social services, education, roads, science, aborigines, and drug abuse; other issues such as taxation, inflation, crime and punishment, business affairs, uranium, poverty, women and careers, and migrants; feelings toward major Australian political figures, Mr Reagan, Mrs Thatcher, certain social and national groups, and certain countries; confidence in institutions such as banks, police, government, political parties, the military, universities and schools, the press, companies, trade unions and small business; and perceived economic and social priorities for Australia over the next ten years. Other questions relate to the respondent's personal feelings about life, such as loneliness, happiness, satisfaction, level of control, and identity; health, the need for medical services, and availability of trustworthy friends; religious beliefs and priorities; moral reactions to sex, abortion, pornography; facets of human nature; relationships with parents and children; and a sentence completion test. Political data includes party preference and voting history; spouse's party preference; willingness to act to change things; and perceptions of personal feelings of power. Economic data includes detailed information on income from various sources for both respondent and spouse; hours and weeks worked; occupations (coded into the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations: Working Draft); and spouse's education and occupation. Background variables include family history; employment history; education; birthplace; ethnic origin; places of residence; parental occupation and education; religion; age; sex; current state and size of town; place of upbringing; number of years in current area; home ownership; marital status; number, sex and age of children; and union membership.

    The Australian Election Study is the second in the series initiated in 1987, and builds on the data collected earlier in the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The series provides a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigates the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term perspectives it examines the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result. 
    
    Two major themes are covered in the survey, the economy and the environment. Questions on the economy include retrospective and prospective evaluations of the country's economy and the individual's own personal household situation; wages and price controls; attitudes to particular economic issues; and the position of the major parties and party leaders on the main economic issues. Questions on the environment include attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general; the role of industry and the government in ensuring environmental protection; rankings of the most urgent environmental issues and the respondent's assessment of their likely future importance; and attitudes toward environmental pressure and interest groups, including current or likely membership.  
    
    As in the 1987 AES, a range of questions are included in the survey which cover election issues and the respondent's assessment of the most effective party to handle them, as well as questions on specific political issues such as government spending and the pilots' dispute. A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care and many others. A section on industrial policy focuses on attitudes towards the control of the economy, attitudes to trade unions and big business, and to industrial conflict in general. In addition to the standard questions on vote in the current election, recalled vote in the 1987 federal election, and party identification, the survey contains an extensive section dealing with attitudes to the major parties and to the party leaders. Finally, a range of demographic data are collected for each respondent and their spouse or partner, if applicable.

    The Australian Election Study is the second in the series initiated in 1987, and builds on the data collected earlier in the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The series provides a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigates the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term perspectives it examines the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result.

    'Viable' parliamentary candidates for 24 March 1990 Australian federal election. Because of the large number of independent and minor party candidates who stood in the election, the survey is not based on a sample in any conventional sense. To be eligible for selection, candidates had to meet one or more of the following criteria: 1. Endorsed candidates of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, National Party, Australian Democrats, and the Nuclear Disarmament Party
    
    2. Candidates with labels explicitly identifying them as environmentally concerned (except the Australian Green Party )    
    
    3. Candidates who were endorsed by significant Green pressure groups
    
    4. Other candidates who it was anticipated would obtain more than 10 per cent of the first preference vote

    Candidates for the House of Representatives and Senate in the Federal election were surveyed, as in the Australian Candidate Study, 1987.  In 1990, however, the survey was restricted to candidates for the major parties - Labor, Liberal, National and Australian Democrat - plus candidates standing on green and environmental platforms; other minor party candidates and independents were not included.  
    
    The study examines the political issues prevalent in the election, replicating some of the questions on the economy, the environment, social issues and industrial policy which were asked in the Australian Election Study, 1990 (SSDA No. 570).  These include candidates' attitudes to particular economic issues, attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general.  A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care, and many others.  A section on women focuses on women's issues, support for women, attitudes to women and attitudes to women as election candidates.  This will enable extensive replication to be conducted focusing on mass-elite linkages, both across the electorate as a whole, and disaggregated by party. 
    
    In addition, the survey asks questions relating to political background, including electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations, together with questions on pre-selection, such as the support which the candidate was given to gain nomination.  A section on campaigning asks for candidates' perceptions of the personal attributes and experience which they think are required to make a successful candidate and MP, and the activities that the candidate engaged in during their campaign. 
    
    Data collected on social and political characteristics of candidates, plus certain social and political features of the electoral divisions in which they stood (for House of Representatives candidates only), has been linked to the candidates' questionnaires.  However, due to confidentiality provisions, only subsets of these variables can be provided for analysis.  The variables are: house contested; state; electoral division*; party affiliation; sex; occupation; whether elected or not; first preference vote in 1990 election*; position on ballot; incumbency status; years in parliament; ministerial status; number of candidates on ballot; median income in electoral division*; urban-rural location of electoral division*; two-party preferred vote in 1987 in the electoral division; two-party preferred vote in 1990 in the electoral division*.

    The National Social Science Survey is a multi-purpose survey measuring a wide range of variables of interest in sociology, political science and labour economics.  The survey consists of three waves: 1984-1985, 1986-1987, and 1987-1988.  The sample was redrawn for each wave of the survey and therefore the results do not form a panel series.
    
    Successive waves of the survey had different research foci, such as an emphasis on the role of government in 1986-87, and attitudes to income inequality in 1987-88. ASSDA No. 594 is an integrated data set, comprising variables which were common to the three waves.  These variables included respondents' social background characteristics in addition to a number of common attitude items.
    
    Questions relate to the respondent's personal feelings about life such as loneliness, happiness, satisfaction, identity and personal worth; religious beliefs and priorities; moral reactions to sex, abortion and pornography; and facets of human nature.  The questionnaire also covered attitudes towards uranium mining, inequality, the Public Service, aborigines, trade unions, the death penalty, women and careers;  feelings toward major Australian political figures, certain social and national groups, and certain countries; confidence in the government; government ownership of public authorities; and government spending on the environment, health, police, the aged, unemployed and military. Aspects of job satisfaction are canvassed.   
    
    Political data includes interest in politics, left - right assessment, party identification and past vote and current vote intention.  Economic data include details from respondents about themselves and their spouses, of money received in the form of pensions, welfare entitlements, inheritance, dividends and  business income, which have all been adjusted for inflation; hours and weeks worked; occupations (coded into the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations).
    
    Background variables include marital status, educational history, state of birth,  country of origin, home ownership, church attendance, religion, self identified class, and trade union membership. Additonal spouse details include occupation, party identification, current employment status, years at school, and trade union membership. Background variables regarding the respondent's parents include occupation, work history and job responsibilities, party identification and educational qualifications.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The study aims to provide information on deaths which occurred in police and prison custody throughout Australia in the 1980s, in order to place the phenomenon of aboriginal deaths in custody in the broader context of all deaths in custody during the period.
    
    Topics covered include the time, environment and cause of the death, amount of time since the last inspection of the prisoner, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), and characteristics of the custody (legal status, number of days in custody, custodial authority).  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender, and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    The principal objectives of the Rights in Australia project were: to establish the level of support for civil liberties and civil rights among Australians; to determine the firmness or solidity of Australians' attitudes to civil liberties; to explore how Australians make up their mind in specific civil liberties controversies, especially where there are competing sides to a situation; and to identify principal characteristics which might affect the support or rejection of certain civil liberties.  This data release represents the first stage in the project: the surveying of a representative sample of the Australian population. The second stage (ASSDA No. 619) comprises interviews with a 'decision makers' sample - individuals from three groups, the legislature, the judiciary and the executive (public servants, public prosecutors and police officers).
    
    The household survey consisted of a telephone interview, followed by a questionnaire distributed by mail.  The telephone interview began with questions designed to establish a general measure of the respondent's attitudes to equality of rights and tolerance of actions against the government.  This was followed by a section dealing with more specific rights issues - freedom of speech, racial discrimination, and freedom of choice, including censorship, euthanasia, abortion and homosexuality.  Further sections dealt with: legal rights - right to trial, right to trial by jury, contact with the police; sexual discrimination; racial prejudice towards Asians and Aboriginals; and the issue of a Bill of Rights for Australia.  The mail survey consisted of additional questions covering the same range of issues.  In the telephone interview, background information was collected on political orientation, vote at last election, interest in politics and compulsory voting.
    
    Demographic information collected about the respondent included age, sex, country of birth and year of arrival in Australia, citizenship status, age starting and leaving school, type of school attended, highest qualification, religion and frequency of church attendance, marital status, numbers of children and numbers in the household, occupation and labour force status, trade union membership and household income.

    The objective of this study was to provide information on environmental values, and in particular to estimate the dollar value Australians would place on the Conservation Zone and Kakadu National Park if mining were not permitted in the Zone compared with their valuations if mining were permitted, with possible environmental damage. The survey was split into two samples: a sample of Northern Territory residents; and a sample of residents of all other states.
    
    These individual valuations were determined using contingent valuation, a method of placing dollar values on aspects of the natural environment. The contingent valuation method constructs a hypothetical market for the amenity in question. In this survey, respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay to prevent possible environmental damage from mining in the Conservation Zone. Because the extent of environmental damage from proposed mining is in dispute, the survey group was split in two. A different description of environmental impact was presented to each group: the first stated that there would be very little damage and that damage would be limited (the minor impact scenario); and the second described the risks of damage as significant and the impact substantial (the major impact scenario). In addition, respondents were asked to respond to values already defined, that is, instead of respondents being asked what they would be willing to pay, they were asked if they would be willing to pay a specified amount. 
    
    In addition to specific contingent valuation questions, the survey also asked respondents a series of attitude questions ranging from the importance of recreational activities within national parks, the relationship between jobs and natural resources, the importance of Aboriginal cultural concerns, and the financial benefits to Australia. Respondents were also asked whether they thought governments paid attention to individual views on natural resources; the importance of forests and Australia's timber resources; and four behavioural questions - whether they recycled household materials, the purchase of environmentally sound products, the watching of environmental programs on TV and membership of a conservation organisation. Background information covered age, sex, education level, income, job status, industry, occupation and country of birth.

    The 1993 Australian Election Study is the third in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1993 survey replicates many questions from the 1987 and 1990 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on foreign affairs and defence, and attitudes to Federal and State government. As in previous surveys, other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.
    
    Background variables covered include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, year and place of birth, parents' birthplaces, parents' political preferences, father's occupation, length of residence in state or territory, religion, marital status, number of children, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    In 1985 a study of drug use patterns and attitudes amongst secondary school students was conducted by the Health Department of Victoria. The objectives of the study were to identify the current alcohol and drug use patterns of Victorian secondary school students and to look at the relationship between substance use and a number of social and personal indicators. The results were used to assist in determining the appropriate delivery of existing intervention programs and for the development and targeting of future programs. This study was repeated in 1989 and 1992 to identify changes over time, if any, in patterns of usage and attitudes, thus helping to evaluate the effectiveness of established drug programs.
    
    Students were asked about their use of the following drugs - steroids, inhalants, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy, and in particular, cigarettes/tobacco, alcohol, pain killers, tranquillisers, and marijuana. Questions included at what age the respondent first tried the drug, how often they used the drug, the source of the drug and what effect the drug had on them. Opinions on the use of drugs (e.g. how dangerous they believed use of a particular drug was) were also sought as was the source of their information on drugs and their effects.
    
    Background variables included sex, age, place of birth, the year level at school the respondent was currently in, whether the respondent was an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and if more than one language was spoken at home.

  universe: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

  universe: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don't drink alcohol.  
    
    A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.
    
    Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.

    This study is one element in the ACT Drug Indicators Project which aims to produce a system to attempt to estimate the incidence, prevalence and character of illegal drug use in the ACT area and to monitor relative changes in drug use levels and patterns over time. 
    
    Two different questionnaires were used to obtain data, one filled in by participating drug treatment agencies on each new admission (1729) and the other filled in by police on each drug arrest (774). The drug treatment and welfare agencies were able to obtain more detailed information on drug use and drug treatment while the police were able to obtain more detailed information on current and prior criminal charges.
    
    The main variables from the police questionnaire included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; prior criminal record; current criminal charges and drug charge types. The main variables from the drug agencies included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; mode of drug use; frequency of use;  referral source and previous drug treatment. 
    
    Background variables included: sex, residential area, marital status, age, country of birth, Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal, accommodation type, employment status, number of children under 18 and number of children under 18 living with the client.

In 1996, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, and the Greens.  The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia.  Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought.  A section on national identity includes questions on national pride, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and citizenship.  In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations.  A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources.  ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.  Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with.  Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.

    The 1998 Australian Election Study is the fifth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1998 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on the constitution, rights and minorities.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the GST, immigration, unemployment, the Telstra sale, and education, views on the monarchy and the importance of Australia becoming a republic, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including euthanasia, abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    This study is the sixth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1998. The five earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. In addition, self-completion questionnaires were administered to two supplementary samples.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, marijuana, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy/designer drugs and inhalants. This survey also includes extra questions on State and Territory regulations on Cannabis use, alcohol and drug related incidents and respondent's friends drug use, a section on Methadone, and the SF-36 survey instrument to enable a personal health 'score' for each respondent to be calculated.
    
    Background variables include state, geographic location, sex, date of birth, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and household descriptions.

  abstract: The 1999 Australian Constitutional Referendum Study was conducted to investigate the Australian electorate's attitudes towards the significant political issues surrounding the 1999 constitutional referendum.  As part of the Australian Election Study series, the 1999 ACRS provides a perspective on the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian public which, in turn, can be compared to those attitudes recorded at past and future electoral events.  The 1999 ACRS also functions more specifically as a means of investigating the patterns of public opinion concerning the republic and its specific features.  Variables include voting preference; degree of exposure to media reporting of the Referendum; level of interest in the Referendum debate; past and present political affiliation; party voted for in the last (1998) election; evaluation of parties, politicians and key participants   in the Referendum debate; views on national identity, preferred head of state and the importance of the Queen and the Royal Family to Australia; knowledge of the current role of the Queen and the Governor General and future role the President if Australia became a republic; perceived changes to powers held by the Prime Minister and the President, political stability in Australia, Australia's standing in the world, and ease of future constitutional reform; attitudes to a range of issues including unions, big business, income distribution, law enforcement, equal opportunities for migrants/women,  Aboriginal land rights; and views on the preferred function of society, government and the law.

    The 2001 Australian Election Study is the sixth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2001 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

    Surveys in other countries suggest that children and adolescents experience high rates of mental health problems, however in Australia there has been no information at a national level about the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health problems. The Child and Adolescent Component of the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being is the first survey to investigate the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents at a national level in Australia. It provides an accurate estimate of the prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents in Australia. It also provides information about the degree of disability associated with mental health problems and the extent to which children and adolescents are receiving help for their problems.
    
    Information was collected from children aged 4-17 and their parents. Children and parents completed questionnaires assessing mental health problems (assessed using the Youth Self-Report and Child Behaviour Checklist) health related quality of life, health-risk behaviour and service utilisation. In addition, parents completed a face-to-face interview (3 modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) designed to identify Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Conduct Disorder.  
    
    Background variables include age, sex, metro/rural, parents employment/ education/income.
    
    Thi restricted version of the dataset includes extra variables containing information on respondents' aboriginality. The approval of the depositors is required to access this dataset. 
    
    The raw data collected in the survey has not been published but also available under the same access conditions.

The Child and Adolescent Component of the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being is the first survey to investigate the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents at a national level in Australia. It provides an accurate estimate of the prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents in Australia. It also provides information about the degree of disability associated with mental health problems and the extent to which children and adolescents are receiving help for their problems.
    
    Information was collected from children aged 4-17 and their parents. Children and parents completed questionnaires assessing mental health problems (assessed using the Youth Self-Report and Child Behaviour Checklist) health related quality of life, health-risk behaviour and service utilisation. In addition, parents completed a face-to-face interview (3 modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) designed to identify Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Conduct Disorder.  
    
    Background variables include age, sex, metro/rural, parents employment/ education/income.
    
    Thi restricted version of the dataset includes extra variables containing information on respondents' aboriginality. The approval of the depositors is required to access this dataset. 
    
    The raw data collected in the survey has not been published but also available under the same access conditions.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.
    
    This is the restricted version of the dataset, which includes the postcode variable.

    This study is the eighth in a series of national household surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-2001. The seven earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. For the 'Drop & collect' sample, a sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. For the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) sample these sections were asked directly by the interviewer.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/ analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, cannabis, heroin, methadone, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy, GHB, ketamines and inhalants.
    
    Background variables include state, remoteness category, sex, age, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and index of socio-economic disadvantage, and household descriptions.

The drugs covered included: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain-killers/analgesics, tranquillisers, barbiturates, heroin, methadone, inhalants, ketamines, GHB, ecstasy, LSD, hallucinogens, cocaine, meth/amphetamines, opiates, cannabis/marijuana, and steroids.
    
    Background variables included: state of residence, age, sex, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, level of education, income, index of socio-economic disadvantage and household descriptions.

  abstract: "A national survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services (Byrne, Garwood, Moorcroft, and Barnes, 1995) in Australian libraries, followed by case studies in a select number of libraries. \n\n\
    This project concerns a series of good practice protocols by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network (ATSILIRN) in 1995. The Protocols were developed to guide libraries, archives, and information services to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities which the organisations serve, and\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Handle materials with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content.\n\n\
    A literature search indicates that a number of organisations (both LIS and non-LIS based) refer to the protocols but there is no evidence of any research conducted into the relevance and application of the protocols at an institutional level.\n\n\
    A research team at the University of Technology Sydney, endorsed by ATSILIRN, conducted a study into the practical implementation of the protocols across Australia. All relevant library, archive and information service institutions were invited to take part in a national survey. The researchers will follow this up with a study of innovative or exemplary practices to further assist institutions in applying the protocols.\n\n\
    It is anticipated that the research will be used to compile a number of reports covering but not limited to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Relevance of the protocols at local, regional and national institutions\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Issues and concerns of institutions relating to Indigenous issues.\n\n\
    Papers are also planned for national and international conferences with the aim of enlisting support for a consistent approach to Indigenous materials held in libraries, archives and information services."

    File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.
    
    File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.
    
    File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 
    
    Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.
    
    File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent's general impressions about the EIP job creation program.
    
    Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.
    
    The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.
    
    The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.

    The study has two goals. The first is to continue the broad line of enquiry established by the 1967 and 1979 Australian National Political Attitudes surveys so that patterns of stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate can be traced over two decades. The second is to assess the electoral impact of forces specific to this election in order better to understand its outcome.
    
    Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the 1987 and 1984 Federal elections; when they had decided how to vote and whether they might have changed their vote; party identification; interest in politics; the importance of a number of issues and the media in deciding their vote; left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties in the 1987 and 1984 elections; feelings about the party leaders indicated by ratings from 0 to 10, their qualities and effectiveness as prime minister. A section on election issues covered perceptions of Australia's current economic situation and the extent of the effect of government policies on the economy; government spending; privatisation; the role of trade unions and big business; uranium mining; law and order; Asian migration; marijuana; abortion; aborigines; testing for AIDS; censorship; homosexuality; opportunities for women. Other questions examined trust in government; political goals; and forms of political action.
    
    Background information included level of schooling; highest level of qualification; current activity; occupation; employment sector; supervision; union membership; self assessed social class; sex; age; length of current residence; country of birth of self  and parents; year arrived in Australia; father's occupation; parents' schooling and political preference; marital status; number of children; partner's schooling, occupation, employment sector, supervision, union membership and political preference; religion and attendance at religious services.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  Since some 60 per cent of the Aboriginal deaths in custody being investigated by the Royal Commission occurred in police custody, it was considered important that data be available on the numbers and characteristics of people held in police cells in Australia.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the timing and reasons for the individual's placement in custody and removal from custody, and whether the individual was alone or with others during custody.  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and geographical location.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The purpose of the study was to obtain information on adult deaths which were reported to have occurred while the person was serving a non-custodial correctional order.  'Non-custodial correctional orders' included all orders which involve some form of supervision of a person by a correctional authority, outside an institution.  It was intended that the results of the survey could be used to assist in placing into a broader perspective the data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths obtained by other research studies of the Royal Commission.
    
    Topics covered in the present study included the time and manner of the individual's death, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), characteristics of the individual's correctional order, and use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables included geographical location, and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal), marital status, employment status, mental health history, physical health history, most serious offence, and correctional history of the individual.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody. The purpose of the study was to obtain information on self-inflicted harm in custody.  The interest was in both attempted suicide (whether the person actually intended to die from the attempt or not) and other forms of self-harm, such as lacerations.  It was intended that the information could be used to help develop policies and practices that may reduce the incidence of self-inflicted deaths in custody.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the time, place and form of self-injury, the immediate reaction of custodial staff and subsequent action (e.g. bail to attend hospital, counselling), and the use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables include geographical location and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or nonaboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender.

    Rural and remote areas of Australia suffer from inadequate rates of recruitment of health workers and low rates of retention.  This may partly be attributed to professional isolation experienced by health workers in these areas, while they require a wide range of professional skills.  The aim of this survey was to review current post-secondary education opportunities for rural and remote area health workers.  The database would be used to evaluate deficiencies in programs for rural health with particular reference to those involved in areas of alcohol related problems, child abuse, sexual assault and domestic violence.
    
    The data set consists of information about post-secondary courses which are available and relevant to rural and remote area health workers.  It was designed to be relevant to all types of health workers including medical practitioners, registered and enrolled nurses, aboriginal health workers, counsellors, social workers, pharmacists, dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, ambulance personnel, community workers, and other allied health and welfare workers.  The data include courses/units specifically orientated to the conditions of health service delivery in rural and remote areas, and courses/units which may be recommended for, or interesting to, rural and remote area health workers.   One data file lists each such course, giving details of the institution, contact person, subject, award level, prerequisities, requirements for attendance, and possibilities for part-time or external study. The second data file lists each unit with information about the course title, unit title, year, semester,  and course credit.

    The National Centre of the Cervix Screening Policy was developed following a report made by the Cervical Cancer Screening Evaluation Steering Committee of the Australian Health Minister's Advisory Council.  The evaluation called for an organised approach to screening for cancer of the cervix based on an agreed national policy.  The resulting policy states that all asymptomatic women aged 18-70 who are, or who have ever been, sexually active should have biennial Pap Smears.
    
    The Cancer of the Cervix campaign was developed as a strategy to communicate the aims of this policy to Australian women.  National pre and post-campaign surveys were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign in providing women with information about the policy, specifically information regarding Pap Smears and the need for biennial screening.
    
    Respondents were asked whether they had heard of Pap Smear tests; if they had observed any advertising and/or other information on Pap Smears; what they thought the tests were used to detect; the plausibility of reasons for not having Pap Smears; their own reason for not having a Pap Smear; how often they had had Pap Smears in the past and how often they propose to have them in the future; the age and reason when Pap Smears are no longer needed; and whether they had had an abnormal Pap Smear result.
    
    Background variables include age, whether the respondent is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent; whether English is the main language spoken in the household; marital status; highest level of education; occupation; annual income; and occupation and annual income of the main income earner.

In 1993, candidates from the following political parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, The Greens, The Greens (Western Australia) Inc, The Green Party of South Australia and the Green Alliance Senate-New South Wales.  The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, employee control of industry and Australia's trading relationship with foreign countries. Opinions on other political issues such as defence spending, the need for new security arrangements, countries perceived to pose a threat to Australia, and the republic issue were also sought. A section on social policy includes questions on contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, the death penalty and many others.  In addition, the survey asks questions relating to political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations, and questions on the role of the representative, such as important aspects of the MP's job. A section on campaigning asks for candidates' perceptions of the personal attributes and experience which they think are required to make a successful candidate, how long before the election they organised and started their campaign, and what deciding factors led the candidate to run in their first Federal election. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.  Background variables include age, country of birth, parents country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, house contested, and party affiliated.

    The 1990 EEO Public Sector Survey was conducted to determine progress under the EEO program since the last survey in 1985 and to provide information about employment patterns and opportunities within the New South Wales public sector. The study was designed to provide representative information on the employment experiences of women, Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background and people with physical disabilities in the public sector.
    
    Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects, differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of minority groups, training and development courses and own education. Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and details of any disabilities were also recorded.  The questionnaire asked respondents about their experience (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.
    
    Background variables include age, sex, birthplace and educational status.

To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

    This study is the fifth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current attitudes towards drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1995. The four earlier studies were Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; and the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; and supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal population in 1994. This survey is also the first survey in the National Drug Strategy Household Survey series which has followed on from the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey Series.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern about various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. The drugs covered were: alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine/crack, ecstasy/designer drugs, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants (eg. glue, petrol), marijuana/hash, pain killers/analgesics, steroids, tobacco/cigarettes and tranquillisers. Respondents were also asked if they had been victims of physical and/or verbal abuse and property damage and/or theft by someone affected by alcohol or had themselves committed these offences when under the influence. This survey also includes extra questions on health, marijuana attitudes, and co-use of drugs.
    
    Background variables included geographical location, sex, age group, birthplace, employment status and occupation of self and spouse, education status, and the number and ages of other people in the household.

    The 1996 Australian Election Study is the fourth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result.
    
    The 1996 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990 and 1993 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on national identity.  Other sections covered the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, attitudes to foreign affairs and defence issues and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.

    The 2001 Australian Candidate Study is the sixth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2001, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, the Greens and One Nation.
    
    The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on what are considered to be the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on political and social institutions includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and racism. In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, political party involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.
    
    Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with.

    This study is the eighth in a series of national household surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-2001. The seven earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995; the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998; and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001. A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994.
    
    As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. For the 'Drop & collect' sample, a sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. For the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) sample these sections were asked directly by the interviewer.
    
    The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/ analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, cannabis, heroin, methadone, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy, GHB, ketamines and inhalants.
    
    Background variables include state, remoteness category, sex, age, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and index of socio-economic disadvantage, and household descriptions.

    The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.

The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.
    
    The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent's interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.
    
    Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents' country of birth, parents' political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent's spouse.
