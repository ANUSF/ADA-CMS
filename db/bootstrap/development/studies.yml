    This survey of the New South Wales subset, is a follow-up to a 1965 study which investigated a sample of New South Wales and South Australian Aboriginal households. The aim of this second wave was to examine changes that had occurred in social and economic conditions since 1965.
    
    Topics investigated include household composition, ownership and physical characteristics of the dwelling and details of visitors; health including child mortality, ante-natal and infant care, use of health services and medical insurance; education, literacy, employment, hospitalisations, trade union membership, income (individual and household), assets, and chief recreation. Attitudinal questions asked were related to schooling, health services, Aboriginal languages, Aboriginal land rights, political parties, police, officials of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme, the Aboriginal Health Service, changes since 1965 in the economic situation of Aborigines, and local Aboriginal leadership. 
    
    Demographic variables covered age, sex and relationship to head of household.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The purpose of the study was to obtain information on adult deaths which were reported to have occurred while the person was serving a non-custodial correctional order.  'Non-custodial correctional orders' included all orders which involve some form of supervision of a person by a correctional authority, outside an institution.  It was intended that the results of the survey could be used to assist in placing into a broader perspective the data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths obtained by other research studies of the Royal Commission.
    
    Topics covered in the present study included the time and manner of the individual's death, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), characteristics of the individual's correctional order, and use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables included geographical location, and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal), marital status, employment status, mental health history, physical health history, most serious offence, and correctional history of the individual.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  
    
    In line with normal ADA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ADA and make a case for gaining access to these data.

    Topics covered include the time, environment and cause of the death, amount of time since the last inspection of the prisoner, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), and characteristics of the custody (legal status, number of days in custody, custodial authority).  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender, and geographical location.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  Since some 60 per cent of the Aboriginal deaths in custody being investigated by the Royal Commission occurred in police custody, it was considered important that data be available on the numbers and characteristics of people held in police cells in Australia.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the timing and reasons for the individual's placement in custody and removal from custody, and whether the individual was alone or with others during custody.  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and geographical location.

    This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody. The purpose of the study was to obtain information on self-inflicted harm in custody.  The interest was in both attempted suicide (whether the person actually intended to die from the attempt or not) and other forms of self-harm, such as lacerations.  It was intended that the information could be used to help develop policies and practices that may reduce the incidence of self-inflicted deaths in custody.
    
    Topics covered in the present study include the time, place and form of self-injury, the immediate reaction of custodial staff and subsequent action (e.g. bail to attend hospital, counselling), and the use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables include geographical location and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or nonaboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender.
    
    Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.

First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

  abstract: "A national survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services (Byrne, Garwood, Moorcroft, and Barnes, 1995) in Australian libraries, followed by case studies in a select number of libraries. \n\n\
    This project concerns a series of good practice protocols by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network (ATSILIRN) in 1995. The Protocols were developed to guide libraries, archives, and information services to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities which the organisations serve, and\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Handle materials with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content.\n\n\
    A literature search indicates that a number of organisations (both LIS and non-LIS based) refer to the protocols but there is no evidence of any research conducted into the relevance and application of the protocols at an institutional level.\n\n\
    A research team at the University of Technology Sydney, endorsed by ATSILIRN, conducted a study into the practical implementation of the protocols across Australia. All relevant library, archive and information service institutions were invited to take part in a national survey.

    It is anticipated that the research will be used to compile a number of reports covering but not limited to:\n\n\

    \xE2\x80\xA2 Issues and concerns of institutions relating to Indigenous issues.\n\n\
    Papers are also planned for national and international conferences with the aim of enlisting support for a consistent approach to Indigenous materials held in libraries, archives and information services."

  comment: "A national survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services (Byrne, Garwood, Moorcroft, and Barnes, 1995) in Australian libraries, followed by case studies in a select number of libraries. \n\n\
    This project concerns a series of good practice protocols by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network (ATSILIRN) in 1995. The Protocols were developed to guide libraries, archives, and information services to:\n\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities which the organisations serve, and\n\
    \xE2\x80\xA2 Handle materials with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content.\n\n\
    A literature search indicates that a number of organisations (both LIS and non-LIS based) refer to the protocols but there is no evidence of any research conducted into the relevance and application of the protocols at an institutional level.\n\n\
