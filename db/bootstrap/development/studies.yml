    'Viable' parliamentary candidates for 24 March 1990 Australian federal election. Because of the large number of independent and minor party candidates who stood in the election, the survey is not based on a sample in any conventional sense. To be eligible for selection, candidates had to meet one or more of the following criteria: 1. Endorsed candidates of the Labor Party, Liberal Party, National Party, Australian Democrats, and the Nuclear Disarmament Party
    
    2. Candidates with labels explicitly identifying them as environmentally concerned (except the Australian Green Party )    
    
    3. Candidates who were endorsed by significant Green pressure groups
    
    4. Other candidates who it was anticipated would obtain more than 10 per cent of the first preference vote

  universe: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.

  universe: samples of Aborigines aged 15 years and over were recruited from patients attending the AMS in Perth and Carnarvon.   First, a large sample of Aboriginal, adult patients, nearly 400 in each community, were administered the first interview.  To be eligible for inclusion patients had to consider themselves to be Aboriginal, aged 15 years or older and resident in that community.  For people fulfilling these criteria the only exclusion criteria were severe cognitive impairment, e.g. brain damage or intoxication, or acute illness which would make an interview impossible.
