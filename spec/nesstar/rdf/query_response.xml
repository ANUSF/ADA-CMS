<s:comment>Topics include: whether Federal and State governments are doing enough for Aborigines; whether the respondent agrees with a World Council of Churches report that &#34;racism is entrenched in every aspect of the Australian society&#34;; whether Aboriginal people living on reserves should be given freehold land; whether the respondent would rather see New Zealand compete at the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane or the Third World nations who threaten to withdraw if New Zealand is allowed to compete; attitudes to overseas investors; between unemployment and inflation, which is the greater problem in Australia; whether tariff protection for Australian industries such as the motor vehicle and clothing industries should be reduced; and for women, whether she is responsible for all or most of the household shopping, whether she is employed, and approximately how much money is spent weekly on food and groceries.

Background variables include: age; sex; marital status; level of education; country of birth; household composition (number of persons in household, number children under age 5, number children between 5-12 years old, number children between 13 and 17 years old, age of the youngest person, and number of employed persons); whether respondent has moved in last two years; tenure of dwelling; occupation of self and head of household; voting enrolment; vote intention; income; and telephone ownership.</s:comment>

<n35:engWeight>weighting criteria

With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each metropolitan Statistical Division and in each &#34;rest of State&#34; area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspaper Releases and Computer Sheets.

Whilst the survey is conducted only in private dwellings, it is assumed that people living in non-private dwellings such as boarding houses, hospitals, hotels and motels have similar characteristics to those living in private dwellings.

weighting procedures

The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.</n35:engWeight>

<n36:dataKind>survey</n36:dataKind>
<n36:sampling>multi-stage cluster sample with age and sex quotas

The survey is conducted on the first two weekends of the month.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of 150 small clusters of households throughout the six states and the ACT.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.

The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to 124 Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electorates.

At the next stage of the design, within each Electorate, a number of Electoral Sub-Divisions is chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to latest electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.

Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector&#39;s district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.

At the final stage, within each selected collector&#39;s district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous Monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is ten effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and five effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.

Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 16 and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.

All types of dwellings are called on and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases, the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called on in its place.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is the sixth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1998. The five earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985 (ASSDA No. 405), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988 (ASSDA No. 498), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991 (ASSDA No. 610), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993 (ASSDA No. 765) and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995 (ASSDA No. 862). A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994 (ASSDA No. 824).

As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. In addition, self-completion questionnaires were administered to two supplementary samples.

The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, marijuana, heroin, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy/designer drugs and inhalants. This survey also includes extra questions on State and Territory regulations on Cannabis use, alcohol and drug related incidents and respondent&#39;s friends drug use, a section on Methadone, and the SF-36 survey instrument to enable a personal health &#39;score&#39; for each respondent to be calculated.

Background variables include state, geographic location, sex, date of birth, marital status, birthplace, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and household descriptions.</s:comment>

<n35:engWeight>Four different sets of weights were calculated:

• Sample 1 alone
• Sample 1 and Sample 2 combined
• Sample 3 alone
• All three samples combined 

The sample was designed to provide (within each geographic stratum) a close-to-random sample of households. The selection of S1 and S3 respondents was designed to be unbiased. (The selection of the S2 respondents followed a different procedure, with a deliberate bias towards younger persons and is discussed separately below.)  However, the resulting samples required weighting to correct for imbalances arising in the design and execution of the sampling.  Each respondent was assigned a weight designed to counteract this imbalance overall.  Where estimates are derived from the sample they are based on the weighted samples unless stated otherwise.

The disproportionate sampling by region meant that it was necessary to attach lower weights to respondents from relatively over-sampled regions and higher weights to respondents from relatively under-sampled regions.

Households were selected with equal probability, meaning that the probability of selection of an individual was inversely proportional to the number of persons aged 14+ in the household, this probability being taken into account in the calculation of the individual&#39;s weight, so that respondents in households of different sizes were represented in their due proportions.

As an initial check on the sample composition, within each stratum the selected Census collector Districts (CCDs) were compared with all CCDs on a number of measures, using the results from the 1996 census. This revealed no material bias in the selection of CCDs.

For detailed information on the weights for each sample and final adjustments to weights, please, refer to Section 6 of the Technical Report (see Related Materials).</n35:engWeight>

<s:label>Deaths in non-custodial corrections, Australia and New Zealand,1987-1988</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The purpose of the study was to obtain information on adult deaths which were reported to have occurred while the person was serving a non-custodial correctional order.  &#39;Non-custodial correctional orders&#39; included all orders which involve some form of supervision of a person by a correctional authority, outside an institution.  It was intended that the results of the survey could be used to assist in placing into a broader perspective the data on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal deaths obtained by other research studies of the Royal Commission.

Topics covered in the present study included the time and manner of the individual&#39;s death, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), characteristics of the individual&#39;s correctional order, and use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables included geographical location, and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal), marital status, employment status, mental health history, physical health history, most serious offence, and correctional history of the individual.</s:comment>

<s:label>National Social Science Survey, 1984</s:label>
<s:comment>&lt;p&gt;The Australian National Social Science Survey is a major multi-purpose survey measuring a wide range of variables of interest in sociology, political science and labour economics. It is similar to national social surveys conducted regularly in the U.S.A., Britain and West Germany. Much of the data in the Australian survey are directly comparable with these other surveys. The data are representative of the non-institutionalised population aged 18 years and over, capable of being interviewed in English, in all States and Territories of Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire covers attitudes toward how much money is spent on foreign aid, defence, unemployment, medical and social services, education, roads, science, aborigines, and drug abuse; other issues such as taxation, inflation, crime and punishment, business affairs, uranium, poverty, women and careers, and migrants; feelings toward major Australian political figures, Mr Reagan, Mrs Thatcher, certain social and national groups, and certain countries; confidence in institutions such as banks, police, government, political parties, the military, universities and schools, the press, companies, trade unions and small business; and perceived economic and social priorities for Australia over the next ten years. Other questions relate to the respondent&#39;s personal feelings about life, such as loneliness, happiness, satisfaction, level of control, and identity; health, the need for medical services, and availability of trustworthy friends; religious beliefs and priorities; moral reactions to sex, abortion, pornography; facets of human nature; relationships with parents and children; and a sentence completion test. Political data includes party preference and voting history; spouse&#39;s party preference; willingness to act to change things; and perceptions of personal feelings of power. Economic data includes detailed information on income from various sources for both respondent and spouse; hours and weeks worked; occupations (coded into the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations: Working Draft); and spouse&#39;s education and occupation. Background variables include family history; employment history; education; birthplace; ethnic origin; places of residence; parental occupation and education; religion; age; sex; current state and size of town; place of upbringing; number of years in current area; home ownership; marital status; number, sex and age of children; and union membership.&lt;/p&gt;</s:comment>

<n35:engWeight>&lt;B&gt;Weighting Criteria&lt;/B&gt;
The weighting procedure takes  account  of  oversampling, particularly in Tasmania, and differential response rates between States and Urban/Rural samples, and is  based  on the  comparison  of  the sample distribution by State and Urban/Rural with population figures given in Table A1 and Table A2 of Attachment A.

&lt;B&gt;Weighting Procedures&lt;/B&gt;
The urban sample of  2208  respondents  is  allocated  to States and Territories in proportion to the Population of Urban Centres given in Table  A1  of  Attachment  A.  For example,  the  expected  sample  size in Urban Centres of N.S.W. is:
&lt;PRE&gt;
 4001884
 ------- x 2208 = 803
11007578
&lt;/PRE&gt;
and the weight is therefore 803/662 = 1.21 where  662 is the number in the sample from Urban Centres in N.S.W. The same sampling fraction of 2208/11007578 is applied to the figures  of  Rural Population in Table 2 to give the expected rural sample size  in  each  region, and  the  weight  is  computed  as expected sample size / achieved sample size.

The computed weights  and  the  weighted  and  unweighted sample sizes are given below:
&lt;PRE&gt;
                  Unweighted     Weight      Weighted

&lt;B&gt;Weighting Procedures&lt;/B&gt;
The urban sample of  2208  respondents  is  allocated  to States and Territories in proportion to the Population of Urban Centres given in Table  A1  of  Attachment  A.  For example,  the  expected  sample  size in Urban Centres of N.S.W. is:
&lt;PRE&gt;
 4001884
 ------- x 2208 = 803
11007578
&lt;/PRE&gt;
and the weight is therefore 803/662 = 1.21 where  662 is the number in the sample from Urban Centres in N.S.W. The same sampling fraction of 2208/11007578 is applied to the figures  of  Rural Population in Table 2 to give the expected rural sample size  in  each  region, and  the  weight  is  computed  as expected sample size / achieved sample size.

<n36:collMode>Urban sample: personal interview.

Rural sample: self-completion (mail out, mail back).

For the urban sample, interviewers were provided with Area maps (covering CD pairs) on which start points were clearly identified. They were also provided with Call Sheets on which were recorded the addresses of all households to be called upon - and the results of the calls made. In Area 1, 7 addresses were listed and the results of up to 5 calls per address were noted. In Area 2, 14 addresses were listed and results of up to 3 calls recorded.

Two contact sheets were designed, one for each Area type, and a sheet was completed for each dwelling at which contact was made. The contact sheets were designed to take the interviewer through a systematic process of introduction, enumerating and listing household occupants, randomly selecting a respondent, selecting a substitute if required, and recording contact results.

Once all of the above procedures had been carried out, an interview was undertaken, lasting for an average of two hours. In addition, a questionnaire for completion by the spouse was left at the household where applicable. A reminder telephone call was made to encourage completion and to ensure that the questionnaire was mailed to the ANU.

For the rural sample, a 60 page questionnaire gave comparable data from sample respondents on the respondents themselves and their spouses where appropriate.</n36:collMode>
<n36:dataKind>Survey</n36:dataKind>
<n36:sampling>Stratified area-cluster sample

The sample was selected in two components: an urban sample of localities of 10000 or more persons as of the 1981 Census; and a complementary rural sample using the Electoral Rolls as the sample frame.

The urban sample was selected as follows:

i) A random selection of Collector&#39;s Districts (CDs) was made, each having a probability of selection proportional to the numbers of occupied dwellings within its boundaries. 	

ii) A random selection of start points was made within a CD (dwelling one) and a skip pattern was used such that every fourth private dwelling was included in the sample up to the required number of households. No household substitu- tion was allowed. 	

iii) One person aged 18 years or more within each dwelling was randomly selected using the Kish-grid selection method. 	

Due to cost constraints it was not possible to conduct a study in which no respondent substitution was allowed. The sample was therefore structured into two groups. In AREA 1 a strict Kish-grid approach was utilised whereby no substitution was allowed. Each Area 1 cluster had 7 dwellings with an average target of 4 interviews. One third of the interviews were conducted on this basis. In AREA 2, if the first person selected was unavailable, substitution by another person in the dwelling was allowed. Area 2 clusters were twice the size of Area 1 clusters. To achieve this design 188 CDs were randomly selected and nominated as Area 1 CDs. For each of these CDs an adjoining CD was selected as Area 2.

By the end of August 1984, the first round of interviews in these 376 CDs had virtually exhausted the sample but response rates were substantially below expectation and only 1700 out of a target of 2200 interviews were achieved.

It was therefore decided to re-enter the original clusters and contact those households where a refusal was experienced at the first contact. Minimum and maximum targets for the number of interviews to be completed were set for each region (see Table 1 below) and the Area 2 procedure was followed regardless of the original designation of the CD. Between December 1984 and February 1985, 256 additional interviews were achieved in this second wave.

In the third wave, conducted from March to July 1985, a total of 244 interviews were planned in the following regions: Sydney (100), Country N.S.W. (20), Melbourne (100), and Country Victoria (24). The original start points were selected and the cluster sizes extended as appropriate to achieve the interviews required. The Area 2 procedure, allowing substitution, was again used, and 252 completed interviews were obtained. 
A description of the sampling procedures used in the rural sample is attached (Study Description Attachment A). 


&lt;B&gt;NSSS - SELECTION OF THE RURAL SAMPLE&lt;/B&gt;

&lt;B&gt;1. Coverage&lt;/B&gt;
The  rural  sample  is  designed to supplement the Urban Sample selected by Reark Research. According to information  supplied  by  Terry  Tremayne  of Reark  Research,  the Urban Sample includes all Collection Districts (CD&#39;s) which are part of an urban centre of 10,000 persons or  more.  These  urban centres  are listed in Table 6 of the 1981 Census publications &#34;Persons and Dwellings in Local Government Areas and Urban Centres&#34; (ABS Catalogue  Nos. 2401.0  -  2408.0). The Rural Sample covers the remainder of the Australian population.

Since the Rural Sample was to be  contacted  by  mail,  a  procedure  which allowed  the selection of names and addresses from rural areas is required. The Electoral Rolls were therefore chosen as the sampling  frame,  and  the following procedure adopted to determine the sample size and selection.

&lt;B&gt;2. Sample Size&lt;/B&gt;
Table 1 below gives the 1981 Census population of urban centres included in the urban sample and the expected number of interviews by State.

The expected interviews in each State is approximately in proportion to thePopulation of Urban Centres after allocation of a minimum of 200 interviews to each of SA, WA and Tasmania.

The  distribution  of  the Rural Sample is given in Table 2. The sample is allocated to each State to match the proportion of expected interviews  to Population  used  in  the  Urban  Sample.  Urban  Tasmania  is heavily over represented in the Urban Sample to provide enough interviews  for  separate analysis. Rural Tasmania is similarly over represented in the Rural Sample.

&lt;B&gt;3. Selection of Electoral Divisions&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Using  the  1981  Census CD Master File, with codes for Electoral Divisions resulting  from  the  1984  redistribution  added,  the  Urban  and   Rural populations  of  each Electoral Division were computed. Electoral Divisions were ordered within State by rural population and interviews  allocated  to them  in  clusters  of  five  in  proportion  to  rural  population size by selecting a random starting value and using the required  skip  interval. Selections falling within Electoral Divisions with only a small proportion of rural voters, usually outer metropolitan Divisions, were substituted by increasing appropriately the selections in an adjacent Division from  which selections were to be made.

Table 3  lists  the  Electoral Divisions chosen, the number of clusters of five interviews in each Division and the urban centres of 10,000 persons or more, or some part of them, in the Division.

*  Selected singly rather than in clusters of five - see Section 4.
&lt;/PRE&gt;

&lt;B&gt;4. Selection of Names and Addresses&lt;/B&gt;
Since  the  rural  Sample  was contacted by mail, with the possibility of a response rate as low as 50%, the number of  names  and  addresses  selected from  the  electoral  rolls was doubled by increasing the cluster size from five to ten names.

Each cluster was selected by taking a random number between one and the number  of  electors  on  the  electoral roll for a Division and taking the names corresponding to that number and every tenth following number until the cluster was completed. If the selected random number gave an address within an urban centre of 10,000 or more persons, a further  random  number was  chosen.  Similarly,  any  address  which  fell  within an urban centre during the selection of the remainder of the cluster was ignored.  If, by chance, the end of the roll was reached before a cluster was complete, the selection continued from the beginning of the roll.

In the Northern Territory, the same procedure was followed except that the fourteen names were selected in seven clusters of two names.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>New South Wales Recorded Crime Data 1996-2002: File inc00</s:label>
<s:comment>The New South Wales Recorded Crime Data is a compiled record of crime data obtained from NSW police records.  The data covers the annual periods 1996 to 2002 and  incorporates information on crime incident, person of interest (i.e. person suspected or accused of perpetrating the crime) and victim of the crime.

Incident variables include type of crime incident, premises on which the incident occurred,  type of drug associated with the incident, geographical location of incident, when the incident first occurred, when the incident was reported and if the incident was domestic violence related.

Person of interest variables include person&#39;s criminal status, postcode, date of birth, sex and whether they are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.

Victim variables include type of involvement in the crime, presence of injury, date of birth, country of origin, sex and whether they are Aboriginal or a Torres Strait Islander.</s:comment>

The survey is conducted over a four week (monthly) period to gain a total monthly sample.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of over 200 small clusters of households throughout the six states and two territories.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.

The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to each of Australia&#39;s Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electorates.

At the next stage of the design, within each electorate, a number of electoral sub-divisions are chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to the chosen April 1984 Electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.

Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector&#39;s district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.

At the final stage, within each selected collector&#39;s district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is twelve effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and two clusters of six effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.

Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 14 years and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.

All types of dwellings are called upon and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools etc.  In each of these cases the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called upon in its place.</n36:sampling>

<s:comment>Patients at Perth Aboriginal Medical Service (PAMS) and Carnarvon Aboriginal Medical Service were invited to take part in a study about alcohol and health and why some people don&#39;t drink alcohol.  

A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.

Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.</s:comment>

<s:label>Alcohol, tobacco and other drug use among Victorian secondary school students, 1992</s:label>
<s:comment>In 1985 a study of drug use patterns and attitudes amongst secondary school students was conducted by the Health Department of Victoria. The objectives of the study were to identify the current alcohol and drug use patterns of Victorian secondary school students and to look at the relationship between substance use and a number of social and personal indicators. The results were used to assist in determining the appropriate delivery of existing intervention programs and for the development and targeting of future programs. This study was repeated in 1989 and 1992 to identify changes over time, if any, in patterns of usage and attitudes, thus helping to evaluate the effectiveness of established drug programs.

Students were asked about their use of the following drugs - steroids, inhalants, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, ecstasy, and in particular, cigarettes/tobacco, alcohol, pain killers, tranquillisers, and marijuana. Questions included at what age the respondent first tried the drug, how often they used the drug, the source of the drug and what effect the drug had on them. Opinions on the use of drugs (e.g. how dangerous they believed use of a particular drug was) were also sought as was the source of their information on drugs and their effects.

Background variables included sex, age, place of birth, the year level at school the respondent was currently in, whether the respondent was an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and if more than one language was spoken at home.</s:comment>

<n36:sampling>stratified random sample 

The sampling frame for the selection of schools was based on data from the 1991 ABS School Census.

The schools were stratified into three school systems - Government, Catholic and Independent. Each Government school was then stratified into a broad geographic identifier: metropolitan, non-metropolitan urban and non-metropolitan rural. This step was necessary to accomodate the Department&#39;s desire to over-sample Goverment non-metropolitan rural schools.

Each Catholic or Independent school was stratified into either metropolitan or non-metropolitan.

A further level of stratification was undertaken to ensure representativeness across education regions. Schools were selected from all three systems for the metropolitan regions: Eastern, Southern and Western. Government and Catholic schools were selected from the five non-metropolitan regions. Because of the small number of non-metropolitan independent schools no regional stratification was undertaken.

This gave a total of twenty five strata: thirteen Government, eight Catholic and four Independent.  Schools for each of the twenty five strata were selected such that the probability of a school being chosen was proportional to its enrolment.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>National police custody survey, Australia, August 1988</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  Since some 60 per cent of the Aboriginal deaths in custody being investigated by the Royal Commission occurred in police custody, it was considered important that data be available on the numbers and characteristics of people held in police cells in Australia.

Topics covered in the present study include the timing and reasons for the individual&#39;s placement in custody and removal from custody, and whether the individual was alone or with others during custody.  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and geographical location.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  

In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.</s:comment>

<n36:abstractText>This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  Since some 60 per cent of the Aboriginal deaths in custody being investigated by the Royal Commission occurred in police custody, it was considered important that data be available on the numbers and characteristics of people held in police cells in Australia.

Topics covered in the present study include the timing and reasons for the individual&#39;s placement in custody and removal from custody, and whether the individual was alone or with others during custody.  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and geographical location.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, researchers and other users should be aware that material in this dataset may contain material that is considered offensive. The data have been retained because it represents an evidential record of language, beliefs or other cultural situations at a point in time.  

In line with normal ASSDA policy, variables (such as postcode) which could possibly be used to identify individuals have been removed or recoded from the public data file.  Much of the original data, however, have been made publicy available by other parties, and if researchers would like to access the original data files, they can contact ASSDA and make a case for gaining access to these data.</n36:abstractText>

<n35:engWeight>weighting criteria

With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each metropolitan Statistical Division and in each &#34;rest of State&#34; area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspaper Releases and Computer Sheets.

Whilst the survey is conducted only in private dwellings, it is assumed that people living in non-private dwellings such as boarding houses, hospitals, hotels and motels have similar characteristics to those living in private dwellings.

weighting procedures

The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.</n35:engWeight>

<n36:sampling>multi-stage cluster sample with age and sex quota

The survey is conducted on the first two weekends of the month.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of 150 small clusters of households throughout the six states and the ACT.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.

The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to 124 Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electorates.

At the next stage of the design, within each Electorate, a number of Electoral Sub-Divisions is chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to latest electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.

Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector&#39;s district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.

At the final stage, within each selected collector&#39;s district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous Monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is ten effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and five effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.

Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 16 and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.

All types of dwellings are called on and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases, the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called on in its place.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>National social science survey integrated data, 1984-1988</s:label>
<s:comment>The National Social Science Survey is a multi-purpose survey measuring a wide range of variables of interest in sociology, political science and labour economics.  The survey consists of three waves: 1984-1985, 1986-1987, and 1987-1988.  The sample was redrawn for each wave of the survey and therefore the results do not form a panel series.

Successive waves of the survey had different research foci, such as an emphasis on the role of government in 1986-87, and attitudes to income inequality in 1987-88. ASSDA No. 594 is an integrated data set, comprising variables which were common to the three waves.  These variables included respondents&#39; social background characteristics in addition to a number of common attitude items.

Questions relate to the respondent&#39;s personal feelings about life such as loneliness, happiness, satisfaction, identity and personal worth; religious beliefs and priorities; moral reactions to sex, abortion and pornography; and facets of human nature.  The questionnaire also covered attitudes towards uranium mining, inequality, the Public Service, aborigines, trade unions, the death penalty, women and careers;  feelings toward major Australian political figures, certain social and national groups, and certain countries; confidence in the government; government ownership of public authorities; and government spending on the environment, health, police, the aged, unemployed and military. Aspects of job satisfaction are canvassed.   

Political data includes interest in politics, left - right assessment, party identification and past vote and current vote intention.  Economic data include details from respondents about themselves and their spouses, of money received in the form of pensions, welfare entitlements, inheritance, dividends and  business income, which have all been adjusted for inflation; hours and weeks worked; occupations (coded into the Australian Standard Classification of Occupations).

Background variables include marital status, educational history, state of birth,  country of origin, home ownership, church attendance, religion, self identified class, and trade union membership. Additonal spouse details include occupation, party identification, current employment status, years at school, and trade union membership. Background variables regarding the respondent&#39;s parents include occupation, work history and job responsibilities, party identification and educational qualifications.</s:comment>

<s:comment>The object of the surveys, conducted in New South Wales and South Australia in 1965, was to gain some idea of the social and economic situation of persons identifying as Aboriginal in the more closely settled regions of Australia.

Data on households covered household composition, including sex of head of household, visitors, duration of residence, location of dwelling, type of dwelling, land ownership, rent and payments, details of type of construction, facilities, utilities, furnishings and appliances, consumer durables and books/musical instruments, interior and exterior care and maintenance and whether dwellings condemned.

Data on individuals included housing, age, sex, marital status, race,
relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
 
Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.

Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.</s:comment>

<n36:dataKind>survey</n36:dataKind>
<n36:sampling>non-probability sample

The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.

In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>Australian Candidate Study, 2004</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2004 Australian Candidate Study is the seventh in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2004, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson&#39;s One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.
 
The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on political and social institutions includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and racism. 

In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions. 

Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 1998</s:label>
<s:comment>The 1998 Australian Election Study is the fifth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.

The 1998 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990, 1993 and 1996 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on the constitution, rights and minorities.  Other sections cover the respondent&#39;s interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the GST, immigration, unemployment, the Telstra sale, and education, views on the monarchy and the importance of Australia becoming a republic, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including euthanasia, abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.

Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents&#39; political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.</s:comment>

<s:label>Aboriginal survey, New South Wales panel, 1980</s:label>
<s:comment>This survey of the New South Wales subset, is a follow-up to a 1965 study which investigated a sample of New South Wales and South Australian Aboriginal households. The aim of this second wave was to examine changes that had occurred in social and economic conditions since 1965.

Topics investigated include household composition, ownership and physical characteristics of the dwelling and details of visitors; health including child mortality, ante-natal and infant care, use of health services and medical insurance; education, literacy, employment, hospitalisations, trade union membership, income (individual and household), assets, and chief recreation. Attitudinal questions asked were related to schooling, health services, Aboriginal languages, Aboriginal land rights, political parties, police, officials of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme, the Aboriginal Health Service, changes since 1965 in the economic situation of Aborigines, and local Aboriginal leadership. 

Demographic variables covered age, sex and relationship to head of household.</s:comment>

<n36:sampling>non-probability sample

This survey is the second wave of a study begun in 1965, which investigated a sample of Aborigines in New South Wales and South Australia.

The present survey was aimed at re-interviewing all the New South Wales cases included in the 1965 survey.  New South Wales households interviewed in 1965 were contacted, and new households established by members of 1965 households were traced and contacted.  Information on people who had died since 1965 was obtained, in part because the proportion and causes of Aboriginal deaths were considered to be significant indicators of Aboriginal conditions.

The selection of the 1965 sample was aimed at representing fairly all non-metropolitan areas of the State.  For this purpose New South Wales was divided into five regions: North Coast, South Coast, South West (Cowra to Deniliquin), West (Wellington to Wilcannia), and North West (Dubbo-Collarenebri) except for Moree and Walgett.

For further details, see SSDA study no. 102 and the book by Charles D. Rowley, &#34;Outcasts in White Australia.&#34; Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1972, pp. 305-306.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>Australian Candidate Study, 2001</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2001 Australian Candidate Study is the sixth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2001, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, the Greens and One Nation.

The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on what are considered to be the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on political and social institutions includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy, immigration and racism. In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, political party involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.

Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 1996</s:label>
<s:comment>The 1996 Australian Election Study is the fourth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result.

The 1996 survey replicates many questions from the 1987, 1990 and 1993 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on national identity.  Other sections covered the respondent&#39;s interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, attitudes to foreign affairs and defence issues and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.

Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents&#39; political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.</s:comment>

The sample of electors for all Australia except South Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 1996 election.  The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The South Australian sample was selected manually from the alphabetical microfiche list of electors available for that state in early February.  All Australian citizens over the age of 18 years are required to enrol and vote at federal elections.</n36:sampling>

<n35:engWeight>Weighting criteria

The sampled agencies are weighted based on known workforce figures so that they are represented in proportion to their representation in the Public Sector workforce as a whole.

Weighting procedures

Weights for results were calculated separately for females, for males and for when sex was not specified to increase precision and reduce bias towards the female workforce due to higher response rates from women.

F - workforce number of females
f- number of female respondents
M - workforce number of males
m - number of male respondents
u - number of respondents of unknown sex
uf - estimate of the number of female respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:

uf = f / (f+m) * u

um - estimate of the number of male respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:

um = m / (f+m) * u

Weights are:
for females            Wf = F / (Uf +f)

for males               Wm = M / (Um +m)

for sex unknown    Wu = (F+M) / (f + m + u)

TAFE included their part-time staff in the sample, and due to there being significant differences between part-time and full-time staff, and for female and male staff, the results were further weighted by whether staff were employed full-time or part-time.</n35:engWeight>

<n36:collMode>The method of distribution varied and depended on the size and geographic spread of the organisation. In smaller agencies questionnaires were usually distributed by hand, while in larger agencies they were distributed by mail. In some agencies self-completion in a group setting occured.  Respondents were given the option of using return mail, placing the questionnaires in ballot boxes or handing them to appointed officers.</n36:collMode>

<n36:sampling>Two techniques were used for selecting respondents depending on the size of the agency concerned. Those agencies with fewer than 5,000 employees took a census (78 of the 89 agencies). The other 11 agencies used either area cluster sampling or stratified random sampling.

<n35:engWeight>Weighting criteria

The sampled agencies are weighted based on known workforce figures so that they are represented in proportion to their representation in the Public Sector workforce as a whole.

Weighting procedures

Weights for results were calculated separately for females, for males and for when sex was not specified to increase precision and reduce bias towards the female workforce due to higher response rates from women.

F - workforce number of females
f- number of female respondents
M - workforce number of males
m - number of male respondents
u - number of respondents of unknown sex
uf - estimate of the number of female respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:

uf = f / (f+m) * u

um - estimate of the number of male respondents in the unknown sex group, which is calculated as:

um = m / (f+m) * u

Weights are:
for females            Wf = F / (Uf +f)

for males               Wm = M / (Um +m)

for sex unknown    Wu = (F+M) / (f + m + u)

TAFE included their part-time staff in the sample, and due to there being significant differences between part-time and full-time staff, and for female and male staff, the results were further weighted by whether staff were employed full-time or part-time.</n35:engWeight>

<n36:abstractText>The 1990 EEO Public Sector Survey was conducted to determine progress under the EEO program since the last survey in 1985 and to provide information about employment patterns and opportunities within the New South Wales public sector. The study was designed to provide representative information on the employment experiences of women, Aboriginal people, people of non-English speaking background and people with physical disabilities in the public sector.

Topics investigated were employment details, income, promotion prospects, differential treatment of males and females, differential treatment of minority groups, training and development courses and own education. Language skills (proficiency in English, first language of parents) and details of any disabilities were also recorded.  The questionnaire asked respondents about their experience (if any) of discrimination in their current employment.

Background variables include age, sex, birthplace and educational status.</n36:abstractText>
<n36:accessConditions>The depositor wishes to be informed (by the archive) of use being made of the data, in order to comment on that use and make contact with colleagues of similar interests.</n36:accessConditions>
<n36:collMode>The method of distribution varied and depended on the size and geographic spread of the organisation. In smaller agencies questionnaires were usually distributed by hand, while in larger agencies they were distributed by mail. In some agencies self-completion in a group setting occured.  Respondents were given the option of using return mail, placing the questionnaires in ballot boxes or handing them to appointed officers.</n36:collMode>
<n36:dataKind>survey</n36:dataKind>
<n36:sampling>Two techniques were used for selecting respondents depending on the size of the agency concerned. Those agencies with fewer than 5,000 employees took a census (78 of the 89 agencies). The other 11 agencies used either area cluster sampling or stratified random sampling.

<s:label>Australian Candidate Study, 2007</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2007 Australian Candidate Study is the eighth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2007, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson&#39;s One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.

The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on demography and representation includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy and referendums

In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. 

Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.</s:comment>

<s:label>National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2007</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2007 National Drug Strategy Household Survey was conducted between July and November of 2007 and examines current awareness of attitudes and behaviours toward drugs and drug problems within the Australian community, focussing on respondents personal attitudes toward drugs, knowledge of drugs and drug histories. This is the ninth survey in a series of national household surveys which focus on drugs and drug behaviour and is the fourth in the series conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW). The series also includes the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse: Social Issues in Australia Surveys of 1985, 1988 and 1991. These studies were followed by the National Drug Strategy Household Surveys of 1994, 1995, 1998, 2001 and 2004. A supplement was also produced in 1994 which targeted the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations.

The survey included questions regarding respondents opinions on prevention of drug and alcohol abuse, availability of drugs and alcohol, personal drug and alcohol behavior, opinions on adequacy of drug information and services and how drug information and services might be improved. The drugs covered included: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain-killers/analgesics, tranquillisers, barbiturates, heroin, methadone, inhalants, ketamines, GHB, ecstasy, LSD, hallucinogens, cocaine, meth/amphetamines, opiates, cannabis/marijuana, and steroids.

Background variables included: state of residence, age, sex, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, level of education, income, index of socio-economic disadvantage and household descriptions.</s:comment>

<s:label>The Mental Health of Young People in Australia: Child and Adolescent Component of the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (Restricted Version)</s:label>
<s:comment>Surveys in other countries suggest that children and adolescents experience high rates of mental health problems, however in Australia there has been no information at a national level about the prevalence of child and adolescent mental health problems. The Child and Adolescent Component of the National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being is the first survey to investigate the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents at a national level in Australia. It provides an accurate estimate of the prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents in Australia. It also provides information about the degree of disability associated with mental health problems and the extent to which children and adolescents are receiving help for their problems.

Information was collected from children aged 4-17 and their parents. Children and parents completed questionnaires assessing mental health problems (assessed using the Youth Self-Report and Child Behaviour Checklist) health related quality of life, health-risk behaviour and service utilisation. In addition, parents completed a face-to-face interview (3 modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children) designed to identify Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Conduct Disorder.  

Background variables include age, sex, metro/rural, parents employment/ education/income.

Thi restricted version of the dataset includes extra variables containing information on respondents&#39; aboriginality. The approval of the depositors is required to access this dataset. 

The raw data collected in the survey has not been published but also available under the same access conditions.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Constitutional Referendum Survey, 1999: Public release version</s:label>
<s:comment>The 1999 Australian Constitutional Referendum Study was conducted to investigate the Australian electorate&#39;s attitudes towards the significant political issues surrounding the 1999 constitutional referendum.  As part of the Australian Election Study series, the 1999 ACRS provides a perspective on the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian public which, in turn, can be compared to those attitudes recorded at past and future electoral events.  The 1999 ACRS also functions more specifically as a means of investigating the patterns of public opinion concerning the republic and its specific features.  Variables include voting preference; degree of exposure to media reporting of the Referendum; level of interest in the Referendum debate; past and present political affiliation; party voted for in the last (1998) election; evaluation of parties, politicians and key participants   in the Referendum debate; views on national identity, preferred head of state and the importance of the Queen and the Royal Family to Australia; knowledge of the current role of the Queen and the Governor General and future role the President if Australia became a republic; perceived changes to powers held by the Prime Minister and the President, political stability in Australia, Australia&#39;s standing in the world, and ease of future constitutional reform; attitudes to a range of issues including unions, big business, income distribution, law enforcement, equal opportunities for migrants/women,  Aboriginal land rights; and views on the preferred function of society, government and the law.  Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents&#39; political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.</s:comment>

<n35:engWeight>Weighting criterion to adjust the distribution of responding electors by State/Territory to an equivalent random sample of the national electorate.  Weighting procedure There are two considerations in deriving the sample weights:  (1) Representativeness:  ensuring that the resulting (weighted) sample accurately reflects the proportion of electors enrolled in each State/ Territory. The present data constitute a disproportionate stratified sample that &#34;under-samples&#34; the more populous states of NSW and Victoria, and &#34;over-samples&#34; the smaller states and territories. Thus weights are necessary to adjust the sample by State/Territory to reflect the distribution of enrolments in the population (Australian electors) at the close of the electoral rolls for the referendum.   (2) Precision: ensuring that, after adjusting for these proportions, the resulting sample size is appropriate. Statistical software packages calculate statistics and significance values under the assumption that the data constitute a simple random (probability) sample selected from a large population. Consequently, most statistical software packages do not take the effects of complex sample designs into account. Providing the variances of an item are similar in each State/Territory, the effective sample size indicates the sample size of a simple random sample with (approximately) equivalent precision to the sample design used in the present study. When the sample is adjusted to the effective sample size, statistics from software packages can be used.  The effective sample size, the simple random sample size that would give an estimate of equivalent precision to the sample design used in this study, is calculated as:  	1/n  =  ?[(Nh/N)(Nh/N)(1/nh)]  where the summation is across States and Territories and 	Nh = number of enrolments in the hth State/Territory 	N  = number of enrolments in Australia 	nh = number of responding electors from the State/Territory.  There are 28 additional cases in the file that were returned with the identification number removed and, therefore, the respondents&#39; State/ Territory is unknown. The weight for these cases is 1. Applying the above formula reduces the sample size from 3431 to an effective sample size of 2311 cases.

<n35:universe>Persons on the Australian electoral roll at the close of rolls, October, 1999.</n35:universe>
<n35:weight>Weighting criterion to adjust the distribution of responding electors by State/Territory to an equivalent random sample of the national electorate.  Weighting procedure There are two considerations in deriving the sample weights:  (1) Representativeness:  ensuring that the resulting (weighted) sample accurately reflects the proportion of electors enrolled in each State/ Territory. The present data constitute a disproportionate stratified sample that &#34;under-samples&#34; the more populous states of NSW and Victoria, and &#34;over-samples&#34; the smaller states and territories. Thus weights are necessary to adjust the sample by State/Territory to reflect the distribution of enrolments in the population (Australian electors) at the close of the electoral rolls for the referendum.   (2) Precision: ensuring that, after adjusting for these proportions, the resulting sample size is appropriate. Statistical software packages calculate statistics and significance values under the assumption that the data constitute a simple random (probability) sample selected from a large population. Consequently, most statistical software packages do not take the effects of complex sample designs into account. Providing the variances of an item are similar in each State/Territory, the effective sample size indicates the sample size of a simple random sample with (approximately) equivalent precision to the sample design used in the present study. When the sample is adjusted to the effective sample size, statistics from software packages can be used.  The effective sample size, the simple random sample size that would give an estimate of equivalent precision to the sample design used in this study, is calculated as:  	1/n  =  ?[(Nh/N)(Nh/N)(1/nh)]  where the summation is across States and Territories and 	Nh = number of enrolments in the hth State/Territory 	N  = number of enrolments in Australia 	nh = number of responding electors from the State/Territory.  There are 28 additional cases in the file that were returned with the identification number removed and, therefore, the respondents&#39; State/ Territory is unknown. The weight for these cases is 1. Applying the above formula reduces the sample size from 3431 to an effective sample size of 2311 cases.  The weights, which are included as a variable in the data file, adjust the sample for both representativeness and sample precision. Details of the weights and other relevant information are given in the following table.

<n36:abstractText>The 1999 Australian Constitutional Referendum Study was conducted to investigate the Australian electorate&#39;s attitudes towards the significant political issues surrounding the 1999 constitutional referendum.  As part of the Australian Election Study series, the 1999 ACRS provides a perspective on the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian public which, in turn, can be compared to those attitudes recorded at past and future electoral events.  The 1999 ACRS also functions more specifically as a means of investigating the patterns of public opinion concerning the republic and its specific features.  Variables include voting preference; degree of exposure to media reporting of the Referendum; level of interest in the Referendum debate; past and present political affiliation; party voted for in the last (1998) election; evaluation of parties, politicians and key participants   in the Referendum debate; views on national identity, preferred head of state and the importance of the Queen and the Royal Family to Australia; knowledge of the current role of the Queen and the Governor General and future role the President if Australia became a republic; perceived changes to powers held by the Prime Minister and the President, political stability in Australia, Australia&#39;s standing in the world, and ease of future constitutional reform; attitudes to a range of issues including unions, big business, income distribution, law enforcement, equal opportunities for migrants/women,  Aboriginal land rights; and views on the preferred function of society, government and the law.  Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents country of birth, parents&#39; political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.</n36:abstractText>

<n36:sampling>disproportionate stratified systematic random sample of Australian electors.  The sample was stratified (disproportionately) by State/Territory in order to provide at least 500 respondents from each of the six Australian states so as to facilitate separate analysis of each state. Sample units were drawn as follows: 1000 from each of the six states (NSW, Vic, Qld, WA, SA and Tasmania), 100 from the Australian Capital Territory, and 50 from the Northern Territory.  The sample of Australian electors was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 1999 referendum on 8 October 1999. All Australian citizens aged 18 years and over are required by law to enrol (&#34;register&#34;) for federal elections and referendums. British subjects who were on the roll immediately before 26 January 1984 are also qualified to enrol and vote. Citizens who are aged 17 may provisionally enrol and are eligible to vote if their 18th birthday falls on or before polling date.  The Australian Electoral Commission supplied electors&#39; names and address information only, to be used for this study alone.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>Australian Candidate Study, 2007: Restricted version</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2007 Australian Candidate Study is the eighth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2007, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson&#39;s One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.

The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on demography and representation includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy and referendums

In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. 

Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.</s:comment>

<n36:abstractText>The 2007 Australian Candidate Study is the eighth in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 2007, candidates from the following parties were surveyed - Australian Labor Party, Liberal Party of Australia, National Party of Australia, Australian Democrats, Australian Greens, Pauline Hanson&#39;s One Nation, Family First Party and Citizens Electoral Council of Australia.

The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, and opinions on which are the most critical problems facing Australia. Opinions on other political issues such as security relations with other countries, assistance for Aborigines and women, and social issues such as abortion and pornography were also sought. A section on demography and representation includes questions on the Australian democratic system, the role of the Monarchy and referendums

In addition, the survey asked questions relating to the political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations. A section on campaigning asked for the amount of time candidates spent on campaign activities and the amount of support received from various sources. 

Background variables include age, country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, House contested and party affiliated with. Some of these variables have been grouped to ensure confidentiality for the candidates.</n36:abstractText>

<s:label>Rights in Australia 1991-1992: Decision Makers&#39; Sample</s:label>
<s:comment>The principal objectives of the Rights in Australia project were: to establish the level of support for civil liberties and civil rights among Australians; to determine the firmness or solidity of Australians&#39; attitudes to civil liberties; to explore how Australians make up their mind in specific civil liberties controversies, especially where there are competing sides to a situation; and to identify principal characteristics which might affect the support or rejection of certain civil liberties.  The first stage of this project consisted of the surveying of a representative sample of the Australian population (SSDA No 618). The present stage comprises interviews with a &#39;decision makers&#39; sample - individuals from two groups, the legislative sample (members of major political parties) and the legal sample (judiciary and executive officers including public servants, public prosecutors and police officers).

The decision makers survey consisted of a telephone interview, followed by a questionnaire distributed by mail.  The telephone interview began with questions designed to establish a general measure of the respondent&#39;s attitudes to equality of rights and tolerance of actions against the government.  This was followed by a section dealing with more specific rights issues - freedom of speech, racial discrimination, and freedom of choice, including censorship, euthanasia, abortion and homosexuality.  Further sections dealt with: legal rights - right to trial, right to trial by jury, contact with the police; sexual discrimination; racial prejudice towards Asians and Aboriginals; and the issue of a Bill of Rights for Australia.  The mail survey consisted of additional questions covering the same range of issues.  In the telephone interview, background information was collected on political orientation, vote at last election, interest in politics and compulsory voting.  Participants from the legislative sample were not asked the political involvement series of questions.  

Demographic information collected about the respondent included age, sex, country of birth and year of arrival in Australia, citizenship status, age starting and leaving school, type of school attended, highest qualification, religion and frequency of church attendance, marital status, numbers of children and numbers in the household, occupation and labour force status, trade union membership and household income.</s:comment>

<s:label>Northern Territory post election survey, 1983</s:label>
<s:comment>This is a study of voters and voting behaviour of urban voters in the 1983 Northern Territory election. The survey was conducted immediately after the election. Some questions were designed to allow comparison with the results of the Northern Territory Urban Voters Survey, 1982 [SSDA Study No. 368].

Topics include perceived problems to be dealt with by the Northern Territory Government; voting behaviour in the election just held and in previous territory and federal elections; attitudes towards territory and federal political parties and their policies, in particular their aboriginal policies; future federal voting intention; attitude towards social class structure and class mobility in the Northern Territory; economic development in the Northern Territory.

Background variables include work status; occupation; employer status;
education level; age; religion; sex; period of residence in the Northern Territory and current town of residence.

<s:label>Tertiary education for rural and remote area health workers, 1992</s:label>
<s:comment>Rural and remote areas of Australia suffer from inadequate rates of recruitment of health workers and low rates of retention.  This may partly be attributed to professional isolation experienced by health workers in these areas, while they require a wide range of professional skills.  The aim of this survey was to review current post-secondary education opportunities for rural and remote area health workers.  The database would be used to evaluate deficiencies in programs for rural health with particular reference to those involved in areas of alcohol related problems, child abuse, sexual assault and domestic violence.

The data set consists of information about post-secondary courses which are available and relevant to rural and remote area health workers.  It was designed to be relevant to all types of health workers including medical practitioners, registered and enrolled nurses, aboriginal health workers, counsellors, social workers, pharmacists, dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, ambulance personnel, community workers, and other allied health and welfare workers.  The data include courses/units specifically orientated to the conditions of health service delivery in rural and remote areas, and courses/units which may be recommended for, or interesting to, rural and remote area health workers.   One data file lists each such course, giving details of the institution, contact person, subject, award level, prerequisities, requirements for attendance, and possibilities for part-time or external study. The second data file lists each unit with information about the course title, unit title, year, semester,  and course credit.

<s:label>Australian Everyday Consumption Project, 1994-1995</s:label>
<s:comment>The Australian Everyday Consumption project represents the first ever study of Australians&#39; cultural consumption. The study aims to delineate the cultural activities of Australians and their relationship to social class. The survey covers a broad range of cultural pursuits, and variables include the books, newspapers and magazines people read; the film and television programs they watch; the types of cars they drive and possession of other consumer durables; their musical interests; the suburbs they live in; their homes and levels of home ownership; whether they gamble; their hobbies; whether they play and/or watch sport; membership of clubs; what they eat; their pets; how often they attend galleries, concerts and/or the theatre; the clothes they wear; their families and friends; working conditions and working hours; comparisons with spouse and parents; personal and household financial details; religious beliefs and practices; and their attitudes towards societal classes, culture, politics and government, finance and the economy, trade unions, gender and employment, and Aboriginal land rights.

Background variables include respondent&#39;s age, sex, marital status, level of education, country of birth, work status, income and occupation.</s:comment>

<s:comment>The object of the surveys, conducted in New South Wales and South Australia in 1965, was to gain some idea of the social and economic situation of persons identifying as Aboriginal in the more closely settled regions of Australia.

Data on households covered household composition, including sex of head of household, visitors, duration of residence, location of dwelling, type of dwelling, land ownership, rent and payments, details of type of construction, facilities, utilities, furnishings and appliances, consumer durables and books/musical instruments, interior and exterior care and maintenance and whether dwellings condemned.

Data on individuals included housing, age, sex, marital status, race,
relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
 
Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.

Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.</s:comment>

<n36:dataKind>survey</n36:dataKind>
<n36:sampling>non-probability sample

The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.

In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.</n36:sampling>

<n36:abstractText>Topics in this survey are opinions on the state of the economy, whether technological modernisation leads to unemployment, ways of dealing with unemployment, place of Aborigines, performance of Prime Minister Fraser and Leader of Opposition Hayden, whether certain occupations (including pensioners and unemployed) are well or poorly paid, and who would make the best political leader.  Standard variables are country of birth, marital status, education level, religious denomination, church attendance, occupation and industry of respondent and head of household,  whether head of household works part-time or full-time, father&#39;s education level, father&#39;s occupation and industry, age group,  vote at last Federal election, subjective assessment of social class, number of persons in household, number and ages of children under 16 in household, life cycle, home ownership, gross income of respondent and household and whether on telephone.</n36:abstractText>

<n36:sampling>area-cluster sample

The survey is based on a sample of 2000 households drawn from 123 of the 124 Federal electorates.  The only electorate not included is the Northern Territory.

A number of starting points, proportional to the number of electors, is chosen in each Federal electorate.  Beginning at the dwelling adjacent to the starting point, the interviewer approaches each dwelling until a contact is made and an interview completed.  The next three adjacent dwellings are skipped, and approaches are then made to each dwelling until a second interview is obtained, and so on until the cluster is completed.

Only one interview is obtained from any one household.  The interviewee is selected by taking that person whose birthday comes nearest to the date of the interview, is 18 years of age or older, is enrolled to vote, and is at home.  A sex quota of 4 males and 4 females is imposed within a pair of clusters (8 interviews) of the interviewers workload.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>Aboriginal radio broadcasting in Alice Springs, 1981</s:label>
<s:comment>The aims are to ascertain the level of contact of the white
people of Alice Springs with the ABC station 8AL, to determine to what
extent these people know of or listen to &#39;Aboriginal ways - Cheerios&#39;
and &#39;Aboriginal Ways&#39;, and, to measure the reactions and attitudes of
these white people to Aboriginal programmes broadcast by Aboriginals
for Aboriginals on 8AL.

Topics include: radio and television ownership; whether there are any
FM radio sets in the household; whether the respondent has listened to
radio station 8 (8HA, 8AL, or 8CCC) in the last week; if he has not
listened to 8AL in the last week, whether he has ever listened to 8AL
and if so, whether he has listened to it in the last 6 months; whether
the respondent has heard the programmes &#39;Aboriginal Ways - Cheerios&#39;
and &#39;Aboriginal Ways&#39;, and if no, the reasons for not listening, and
if yes, how often the respondent listens to these programmes; opinion
of the aboriginal programmes heard on ABC radio; whether the
respondent would prefer a different format; whether the respondent has
heard any programmes for aboriginal people on stations other than the
ABC station 8AL and if yes, which ones; and, attitudes about
aboriginal broadcasting. Background information includes age, sex,
occupation, level of education, and household composition.

Data refers to the period from 1st February, 1981 to 14 August, 1981.

relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
 
Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.

Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.</s:comment>

<n36:abstractText>The object of the surveys, conducted in New South Wales and South Australia in 1965, was to gain some idea of the social and economic situation of persons identifying as Aboriginal in the more closely settled regions of Australia.

Data on households covered household composition, including sex of head of household, visitors, duration of residence, location of dwelling, type of dwelling, land ownership, rent and payments, details of type of construction, facilities, utilities, furnishings and appliances, consumer durables and books/musical instruments, interior and exterior care and maintenance and whether dwellings condemned.

Data on individuals included housing, age, sex, marital status, race,
relationship to household head, recent absences from home, illnesses, physical disabilities, medical advice sought, medical insurance cover,
whether a ward of an organisation, hospital admissions, employment,
education, sources of income and membership of community organisations.
 
Females were asked, in addition, about pregnancies, miscarriages, stillbirths and surviving offspring, attendance at pre-natal and baby health clinics and location of other relatives.

Males were asked about dependent children; military service; time spent in government institutions; ownership of vehicles, tools of trade, house, real estate, shares, livestock, insurance policies and property; and about trade union membership and hire purchase.</n36:abstractText>

<n36:sampling>non-probability sample

The New South Wales survey was aimed at covering the State as a whole, except for Sydney.  For reasons of time, costs and mobility of the population, no sampling of dwellings throughout the State was attempted.  The method of selection was first to ascertain, within an area centred in a country town, the number of houses occupied by Aborigines.  The houses were classified according to tenure under which the land on which they stood was held.  As nearly as possible, one-third of dwellings in each category was then chosen for interview.  Where there were two or three dwellings in a small township, one was selected for interview.  The aim was to achieve a fairly representative section within each of the five area divisions.  Attention was also paid to overall numbers, as far as they could be established, living in the different land tenure situations.  Care was taken to avoid country towns which had, in the recent past, been centres of demonstrations, partly to avoid suspicion being cast on the researchers enquiries and mainly because the risk of understatement was preferred to that of exaggeration.

In the South Australian component selection of areas was determined largely by locations where assistance from the Departments of Geography and Social Studies of the University of Adelaide was available.  There was, nonetheless, good reason for selecting the Eyre Peninsula and some hinterland townships tied by rail or road to the main centres, because the results shed some light on the effects of Aboriginal living standards of urbanisation in a newly industrialised region.  Interviews were conducted with twenty-four non-Aboriginal families living nextdoor or adjacent to Aborigines who had been interviewed.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>Aboriginal and non-aboriginal deaths in custody, Australia, 1980-1989</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody.  The study aims to provide information on deaths which occurred in police and prison custody throughout Australia in the 1980s, in order to place the phenomenon of aboriginal deaths in custody in the broader context of all deaths in custody during the period.   
Topics covered include the time, environment and cause of the death, amount of time since the last inspection of the prisoner, responsibility for the death (e.g. suicide, accident), and characteristics of the custody (legal status, number of days in custody, custodial authority).  Background variables include age, sex, race (aboriginal or non-aboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender, and geographical location.</s:comment>

<s:label>Wirangu Language Project, 2004-2009</s:label>
<s:comment>The Wirangu language of the Far West Coast of South Australia is in a state of extreme endangerment. There are currently only two recognised speakers of the language, elderly residents of the Scotdesco Community 100 km west of Ceduna. Apart from this, knowledge of Wirangu is scattered throughout the communities on the FWC, with many people knowing a few words but not how to string them together.

This project set out to collate all of the published and archival sources on Wirangu, to record the last speakers of the language and to stimulate the intergenerational transmission of the language.

Documentation of Wirangu has occurred incidentally, and with varying degrees of quality, from the late 19th century. Sources include explorers&#39; journals, letters, journal articles, audio recordings and a salvage grammar produced by Luise Hercus and published in 1999. The data presented in this dataset is indebted to the latter work.

This dataset consists of material produced by the University of Adelaide in association with Wirangu communities and Aboriginal organisations of the FWC with the assistance of DCITA funding. It contains digital audio recordings of those involved in the Wirangu Language Project; photographs of flora and fauna; Scotsdesco community members; examples of hard to obtain archival materials used in the documentation process; and details of published research products, such as:

- Wardugu Wirn = Hunting for Wombat (Gladys Miller 2005)
- An introduction to Wirangu (Gladys Miller, Paul Monaghan &amp; Peter Mühlhäusler 2006)
- Wirangu Picture Dictionary (Gladys Miller 2005)</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 2004: Supplementary sample</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.

The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent&#39;s interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.

Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents&#39; country of birth, parents&#39; political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.

This dataset (01079-s) contains both the main sample and the supplementary sample.</s:comment>

<n36:sampling>Stratified systematic random sample. The sample of electors for all Australia was drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll by the Australian Electoral Commission following the close of rolls for the 2004 election. The Commission supplied name and address information only, to be used only for this study.  The sample was selected to be proportional to the population on a state by state basis.

Multi-stage sample.  An additional random sample of electors in the Federal Divisions of Reid, Watson, Fowler, Holt, Gellibrand and Maribyrnong was also drawn from the Commonwealth Electoral Roll to boost numbers of respondents who were not born in Australia.  These electorates were chosen as they have a high migrant population.  The sample of 1500 was examined with regard to the perceived ethnic origin of the surnames on the list and 790 were selected to participate in the study on this basis. This sample is referred to as the Supplementary Sample.</n36:sampling>

<n35:engWeight>weighting criteria

With the foregoing method of selection of individuals for the sample, the composition of the sample by age, sex and localities is always closely in line, but never exactly in line, with the distribution of the population by age, sex and localities.  Therefore separate weighting factors are applied to each age/sex group in each metropolitan Statistical Division and in each &#34;rest of State&#34; area in all results shown in the Gallup Poll Newspaper Releases and Computer Sheets.

Whilst the survey is conducted only in private dwellings, it is assumed that people living in non-private dwellings such as boarding houses, hospitals, hotels and motels have similar characteristics to those living in private dwellings.

weighting procedures

The weighting factors that are used in order to bring the sample exactly into line with the population are calculated by dividing the total population in each age/sex/locality cell by the sample size in that cell.  The total population counts are given in the Gallup Poll Computer Sheets.</n35:engWeight>

<n36:dataKind>survey</n36:dataKind>
<n36:sampling>multi-stage cluster sample with age and sex quotas

The survey is conducted on the first two weekends of the month.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of 150 small clusters of households throughout the six states and the ACT.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.

The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to 123 federal electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to latest enrolment figures.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electorates.

At the next stage of the design, within each electorate, a number of electoral sub-divisions is chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to latest electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electoral subdivisions.

Within each selected electoral sub-division, a Census collector&#39;s district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.

At the final stage, within each selected collector&#39;s district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous Monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is ten effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and five effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.

Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 16 years and over based on the age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.

All types of dwellings are called upon and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called upon in its place.</n36:sampling>

<n36:sampling>multi-stage sample with age and sex quotas

The survey is conducted over a four week (monthly) period to gain a total monthly sample.  Each weekend, a multi-stage probability sample is used with a total of over 200 small clusters of households throughout the six states and two territories.  The sampling areas are widely spread and thoroughly representative of both urban and rural areas throughout Australia.

The total sample requirement of clusters is distributed to each of Australia&#39;s Federal Electorates with probabilities of selection proportionate to enrolment figures for April 1984.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of electorates.

At the next stage of the design, within each electorate, a number of electoral sub-divisions are chosen for the sample with probabilities of selection proportional to the chosen April 1984 Electoral enrolments.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of Electoral Sub-Divisions.

Within each selected Electoral Sub-Division, a Census collector&#39;s district is chosen for the sample with a probability of selection proportional to size.  The selection is systematic from a geographical listing of districts.

At the final stage, within each selected collector&#39;s district, a small cluster of consecutive households is called upon beginning with those households where nobody was at home during the two most recent previous monitors in the same area, and then consecutive households.  The cluster size is twelve effective interviews in metropolitan areas, and two clusters of six effective interviews in non-metropolitan areas.

Equal numbers of effective interviews with males and females aged 14 years and over based on an age quota are obtained in each sample locality.  One person only is interviewed in each household.

All types of dwellings are called upon and listed, with the exception of places such as vacant dwellings, boarding houses, hotels, hospitals, religious institutions, military establishments, schools, etc.  In each of these cases the dwelling is ignored and the next household is called upon in its place.</n36:sampling>

<s:label>Australian Candidate Study, 1993</s:label>
<s:comment>The 1993 Australian Candidate Study is the third in a series of election studies on federal election candidates. In 1993, candidates from the following political parties were surveyed - Labor, Liberal, National, Democrat, The Greens, The Greens (Western Australia) Inc, The Green Party of South Australia and the Green Alliance Senate-New South Wales.  The study examined the prominent election issues, including attitudes to particular economic issues, employee control of industry and Australia&#39;s trading relationship with foreign countries. Opinions on other political issues such as defence spending, the need for new security arrangements, countries perceived to pose a threat to Australia, and the republic issue were also sought. A section on social policy includes questions on contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, the death penalty and many others.  In addition, the survey asks questions relating to political background, such as electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations, and questions on the role of the representative, such as important aspects of the MP&#39;s job. A section on campaigning asks for candidates&#39; perceptions of the personal attributes and experience which they think are required to make a successful candidate, how long before the election they organised and started their campaign, and what deciding factors led the candidate to run in their first Federal election. ALP candidates were also asked a series of questions on ALP factions.  Background variables include age, country of birth, parents country of birth, age when left school, number of years of tertiary study, religion, frequency of attending religious services, marital status, house contested, and party affiliated.</s:comment>

<s:label>Self-inflicted harm in custody, Australia, 1989</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is one of several studies conducted for a Royal Commission inquiry into aboriginal deaths in custody. The purpose of the study was to obtain information on self-inflicted harm in custody.  The interest was in both attempted suicide (whether the person actually intended to die from the attempt or not) and other forms of self-harm, such as lacerations.  It was intended that the information could be used to help develop policies and practices that may reduce the incidence of self-inflicted deaths in custody.

Topics covered in the present study include the time, place and form of self-injury, the immediate reaction of custodial staff and subsequent action (e.g. bail to attend hospital, counselling), and the use of alcohol or drugs.  Background variables include geographical location and the age, sex, race (aboriginal or nonaboriginal) and most serious offence of the offender.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 2004: Restricted version</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2004 Australian Election Study is the seventh in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.

The 2004 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and global issues.  Other sections cover the respondent&#39;s interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including the immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and interest rates, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.

Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents&#39; country of birth, parents&#39; political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.

This is the restricted version of the dataset, which includes the postcode variable.</s:comment>

<s:label>National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is the eighth in a series of national household surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-2001. The seven earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985 (ASSDA No. 405), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988 (ASSDA No. 498), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991 (ASSDA No. 610), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993 (ASSDA No. 765), the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995 (ASSDA No. 862), the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998 (ASSDA No. 1016) and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001 (ASSDA No. 1050). A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994 (ASSDA No. 824).

As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. For the &#39;Drop &amp; collect&#39; sample, a sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. For the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) sample these sections were asked directly by the interviewer.

The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/ analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, cannabis, heroin, methadone, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy, GHB, ketamines and inhalants.

Background variables include state, remoteness category, sex, age, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and index of socio-economic disadvantage, and household descriptions.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian values study survey, 1983: self-completion questionnaire</s:label>
<s:comment>The Australian Values Study was undertaken as part of a major international survey to compare fundamental values in different countries throughout the world. It focuses on such areas as attitudes towards work, life satisfaction, family, political, moral, religious and spiritual values, and a wide range of social issues. The study was conducted in two parts. The first stage was a personal interview questionnaire, administered by an interviewer. The data for this stage has been previously documented as &#39;Australian Values Study Survey, 1983&#39; (SSDA Study No. 375). The second stage was a questionnaire left by the interviewer, to be completed by the respondent and mailed back.

Topics covered in the mail-back questionnaire include newspaper and magazine readership; television watching and radio listening; parental attitudes; family costs; division of labour in the household; personal experiences in the previous year; opinions on current social issues such as invitro fertilisation, nuclear arms, terrorism, conditions for aborigines in Australia; views on economic development and growth in Australia, government intervention in business, jobs and trade unions; perceptions of individual companies, changes in the respondent&#39;s own attitudes and opinions; details of food and beverages usually consumed, types of cigarettes and cigars smoked; personal finance, investment and credit card usage; insurance and superannuation; and makes and models of automobiles purchased or preferred. Background variables include age, sex, birthplace, nationality, languages, level of education, employment status, approximate income, occupation, details of main income earner, household pets, home ownership, type of dwelling and size of town.</s:comment>

<s:label>National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2004</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is the eighth in a series of national household surveys to examine current awareness, attitudes and behaviour related to drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-2001. The seven earlier studies are Social Issues in Australia, 1985 (ASSDA No. 405), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988 (ASSDA No. 498), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991 (ASSDA No. 610), the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993 (ASSDA No. 765), the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995 (ASSDA No. 862), the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1998 (ASSDA No. 1016) and the National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 2001 (ASSDA No. 1050). A supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in 1994 (ASSDA No. 824).

As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern regarding various social issues and drugs. For the &#39;Drop &amp; collect&#39; sample, a sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. For the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) sample these sections were asked directly by the interviewer.

The drugs covered were: tobacco/cigarettes, alcohol, pain killers/ analgesics, tranquillisers, steroids, barbiturates, cannabis, heroin, methadone, other opiates, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, LSD, ecstasy, GHB, ketamines and inhalants.

Background variables include state, remoteness category, sex, age, marital status, indigenous status, country of birth, language spoken at home, employment status, occupation, educational attainment, income and index of socio-economic disadvantage, and household descriptions.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian candidate study, 1990: File pub</s:label>
<s:comment>Candidates for the House of Representatives and Senate in the Federal election were surveyed, as in the Australian Candidate Study, 1987.  In 1990, however, the survey was restricted to candidates for the major parties - Labor, Liberal, National and Australian Democrat - plus candidates standing on green and environmental platforms; other minor party candidates and independents were not included.  

The study examines the political issues prevalent in the election, replicating some of the questions on the economy, the environment, social issues and industrial policy which were asked in the Australian Election Study, 1990 (SSDA No. 570).  These include candidates&#39; attitudes to particular economic issues, attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general.  A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care, and many others.  A section on women focuses on women&#39;s issues, support for women, attitudes to women and attitudes to women as election candidates.  This will enable extensive replication to be conducted focusing on mass-elite linkages, both across the electorate as a whole, and disaggregated by party. 

In addition, the survey asks questions relating to political background, including electoral history, party political involvement and membership of community organisations, together with questions on pre-selection, such as the support which the candidate was given to gain nomination.  A section on campaigning asks for candidates&#39; perceptions of the personal attributes and experience which they think are required to make a successful candidate and MP, and the activities that the candidate engaged in during their campaign. 

Data collected on social and political characteristics of candidates, plus certain social and political features of the electoral divisions in which they stood (for House of Representatives candidates only), has been linked to the candidates&#39; questionnaires.  However, due to confidentiality provisions, only subsets of these variables can be provided for analysis.  The variables are: house contested; state; electoral division*; party affiliation; sex; occupation; whether elected or not; first preference vote in 1990 election*; position on ballot; incumbency status; years in parliament; ministerial status; number of candidates on ballot; median income in electoral division*; urban-rural location of electoral division*; two-party preferred vote in 1987 in the electoral division; two-party preferred vote in 1990 in the electoral division*.

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 1993</s:label>
<s:comment>The 1993 Australian Election Study is the third in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 which have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections. The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.

The 1993 survey replicates many questions from the 1987 and 1990 Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on foreign affairs and defence, and attitudes to Federal and State government. As in previous surveys, other sections covered the respondent&#39;s interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the economic situation and economic policies, attitudes to a range of environmental issues, and attitudes to contemporary social policy issues including equal opportunity, censorship, migration, assistance for aborigines, abortion, criminal law, expenditure on social services, the monarchy and the Australian flag.

Background variables covered include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, year and place of birth, parents&#39; birthplaces, parents&#39; political preferences, father&#39;s occupation, length of residence in state or territory, religion, marital status, number of children, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.</s:comment>

A sample of patients aged 15 years and over took part in the first part of the study, which involved a short interview.  Basic demographic data were collected, and questions were asked about drinking and smoking.  A sub-sample of patients took part in a second survey.  This involved a much longer interview about their life and health, and reasons for drinkng and not drinking.

Background variables collected in the first interview included: sex, age, birthplace, usual residence, marital status, children, education, income and employment.</s:comment>

<s:label>Kakadu Conservation Zone contingent valuation survey, Australia, 1990: File nt</s:label>
<s:comment>The objective of this study was to provide information on environmental values, and in particular to estimate the dollar value Australians would place on the Conservation Zone and Kakadu National Park if mining were not permitted in the Zone compared with their valuations if mining were permitted, with possible environmental damage. The survey was split into two samples: a sample of Northern Territory residents; and a sample of residents of all other states.

These individual valuations were determined using contingent valuation, a method of placing dollar values on aspects of the natural environment. The contingent valuation method constructs a hypothetical market for the amenity in question. In this survey, respondents were asked how much they would be willing to pay to prevent possible environmental damage from mining in the Conservation Zone. Because the extent of environmental damage from proposed mining is in dispute, the survey group was split in two. A different description of environmental impact was presented to each group: the first stated that there would be very little damage and that damage would be limited (the minor impact scenario); and the second described the risks of damage as significant and the impact substantial (the major impact scenario). In addition, respondents were asked to respond to values already defined, that is, instead of respondents being asked what they would be willing to pay, they were asked if they would be willing to pay a specified amount. 

In addition to specific contingent valuation questions, the survey also asked respondents a series of attitude questions ranging from the importance of recreational activities within national parks, the relationship between jobs and natural resources, the importance of Aboriginal cultural concerns, and the financial benefits to Australia. Respondents were also asked whether they thought governments paid attention to individual views on natural resources; the importance of forests and Australia&#39;s timber resources; and four behavioural questions - whether they recycled household materials, the purchase of environmentally sound products, the watching of environmental programs on TV and membership of a conservation organisation. Background information covered age, sex, education level, income, job status, industry, occupation and country of birth.</s:comment>

<s:label>The Australian Survey of Social Attitudes, 2007</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2007 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes (AuSSA) is the third in a biennial series that studies social attitudes and behaviour of Australian citizens for the Australian and international research community. AuSSA provides cross-sectional data on the social attitudes and behaviour of Australians, repeating a core questionnaire for each cross-section and fielding specific modules relevant to the changing needs of the social research community. AuSSA is Australia&#39;s official survey in the International Social Survey Program and regularly includes ISSP modules. AuSSA 2007 uses three survey instruments (Version A, B and C) and includes both the ISSP&#39;s Role of Government and Leisure Time and Sports modules.

The 2007 Survey includes attitudes and behaviours that are organised into thirty-five categories: Describing Australia; Leisure Time and Sports; Environment; Role of Government; Crime and Criminal Justice; Risk; Law and Authority; Politics and Media; Culture; Magistrates Court; Geographical Identity; Retirement; Industrial Relations; Culture and Society; Private Health Insurance; Place of Residence; Collective Memory; Financial Future; Religious Attitudes; Ned Kelly; Aboriginality; Government Regulation; Engagement with Asia; Work; Homelessness; The Sacred; Gender; IVF Technology and Sex Selection; Loneliness; Global Networks; Shopping; Politics and Society; Terrorism; People in General; and Membership of Organisations.

AuSSA 2007 also includes demographic and behavioural categories (Personal Background and Your Partner) that survey: sex, year born, income, education, employment, union membership, languages spoken, birthplace, household composition and religion. Also included are questions about the partner of the respondent: employment, highest-level of education and income.</s:comment>

<s:label>Evaluation of the employment initiatives program in Victoria, 1983-1984: File d</s:label>
<s:comment>The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the Employment Initiatives Program (EIP) in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects. The Program was a short-term job creation scheme set up by the Victorian Government in 1982.

File A contains details about all of the EIP projects. Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.

File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.

File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 

Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.

File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent&#39;s general impressions about the EIP job creation program.

Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.

The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.

The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.</s:comment>

<s:label>Mapping the Impact of the 1995 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services</s:label>
<s:comment>A national survey of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Protocols for Libraries, Archives and Information Services (Byrne, Garwood, Moorcroft, and Barnes, 1995) in Australian libraries, followed by case studies in a select number of libraries. 

This project concerns a series of good practice protocols by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Library and Information Resources Network (ATSILIRN) in 1995. The Protocols were developed to guide libraries, archives, and information services to:

• Interact with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the communities which the organisations serve, and
• Handle materials with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander content.

A literature search indicates that a number of organisations (both LIS and non-LIS based) refer to the protocols but there is no evidence of any research conducted into the relevance and application of the protocols at an institutional level.

A research team at the University of Technology Sydney, endorsed by ATSILIRN, conducted a study into the practical implementation of the protocols across Australia. All relevant library, archive and information service institutions were invited to take part in a national survey. The researchers will follow this up with a study of innovative or exemplary practices to further assist institutions in applying the protocols.

It is anticipated that the research will be used to compile a number of reports covering but not limited to:

• Relevance of the protocols at local, regional and national institutions
• Issues and concerns of institutions relating to Indigenous issues.

Papers are also planned for national and international conferences with the aim of enlisting support for a consistent approach to Indigenous materials held in libraries, archives and information services.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 2001</s:label>
<s:comment>The 2001 Australian Election Study is the sixth in a series of surveys beginning in 1987 that have been timed to coincide with Australian Federal elections.  The series also builds on the 1967, 1969 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys.  The Australian Election Studies aim to provide a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigate the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character.  In addition to these long-term goals they examine the political issues prevalent in the election and assess their importance for the election result.

The 2001 survey replicates many questions from the previous Australian Election Studies, but also introduces a variety of new questions including a section on political and social institutions.  Other sections cover the respondent&#39;s interest in the election campaign and politics, their past and present political affiliation, evaluation of parties and candidates, alignment with parties on various election issues, evaluation of the current economic situation, attitudes to a range of election issues including immigration, refugees and asylum seekers, terrorism, taxation, unemployment, and workers entitlements, attitudes to issues relating to the environment and defence, assessment of the current level of racial prejudice operating in Australia today, and opinions on various social policy issues including abortion, equal opportunities, sex discrimination, and government assistance to Aborigines.

Background variables include level of education, employment status, occupation, type of employer, position at workplace, trade union membership, sex, age, own and parents&#39; country of birth, parents&#39; political preferences, religion, marital status, income, and where applicable, the occupation, trade union membership and political preference of the respondent&#39;s spouse.</s:comment>

<s:label>Deterrence of Marijuana use among year 10 and year 11 students in NSW, 1992</s:label>
<s:comment>In light of the current drug policy which acts to deter drug use through law enforcement, the study was undertaken to investigate whether the threat of legal punishment has any influence on marijuana use by high school aged students.  Using a proven theoretical model, influence was measured both in terms of direct deterrence (e.g. through perceptions of arrest risk and fear of punishment) and indirect deterrence (e.g. physical and material cost of complying or not complying with the law; moral commitment to the law; and informal sanctions imposed by peers, family, or other significant members of the potential user&#39;s social network).  Emphasis,however, was placed on the former  in order to evaluate the effectiveness  of law enforcement on drug use and hence its worth as a method of drug control.

Respondents were asked questions on their use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, pain relievers, sedatives, narcotics (e.g. heroin) and other recreational drugs (e.g. stimulants, hallucinogens);  the number of times they  and/or members of their family had been caught for marijuana possession; the consequences of that arrest;  ease, and financial cost, of obtaining marijuana;  their perceived risk of being caught for marijuana possession and/or use; their personal view of those who use marijuana and the health risks associated with usage; and the effect the opinions of others has on their own use of marijuana. 

Background variables include age, sex, parents country of birth, language spoken at home, household composition, and whether the respodent is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.</s:comment>

Topics include: region; funding information; number of jobs funded; whether the project proposes to recruit employees from any particular disadvantaged groups and if yes what group(s); costs of the project; functional area (general community development, health, education, etc.); nature of work and training; and, classification of target labour.

File B contains basic details of the participants employed on EIP projects. Topics include: extent of EIP support for position; age; sex; marital status; whether participant has dependent children; type of EIP position; duration of employment; source of EIP recruitment; country of birth; length of residence in Australia; whether the participant has a disability; whether the participant is Aboriginal; number of hours worked, gross wages and amount of tax paid for last week; and, information on Commonwealth subsidies.

File C contains responses from the interviewees. Topics covered include: employment history; details of EIP recruitment; details about the time employed on an EIP project and attitudes to the experience; details of current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and those not in the workforce; financial and personal history; and, overall impressions of the EIP project. 

Background variables include sex, date of birth, place of birth, whether first language in English, disabilities or illnesses that prevent the respondent from doing certain kinds of work, education information, and employment history.

File D contains responses from respondents (File C) who were reinterviewed. Topics covered include: the date that employment on the EIP program ended and the reasons; details on current workforce status for the employed, the unemployed and for those not in the workforce; details of labour market experience after EIP project and before the respondents current activity; information about financial circumstances; and, the respondent&#39;s general impressions about the EIP job creation program.

Under the program, just under 3300 people, of whom about 3100 had been unemployed for 6 months or more, were employed on 514 job creation projects.  The projects ran for an average period of 6 months between late 1982 and late 1983.

The IAESR was contacted to evaluate the program in terms of its labour market, economic and social aspects.

The two data files included here include details of all projects, 85% of participants, and the results of two surveys: one survey of a sample of 90 participants and a follow-up survey, 12 months later, of the same sample.</s:comment>

<s:comment>This study is one element in the ACT Drug Indicators Project which aims to produce a system to attempt to estimate the incidence, prevalence and character of illegal drug use in the ACT area and to monitor relative changes in drug use levels and patterns over time. 

Two different questionnaires were used to obtain data, one filled in by participating drug treatment agencies on each new admission (1729) and the other filled in by police on each drug arrest (774). The drug treatment and welfare agencies were able to obtain more detailed information on drug use and drug treatment while the police were able to obtain more detailed information on current and prior criminal charges.

The main variables from the police questionnaire included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; prior criminal record; current criminal charges and drug charge types. The main variables from the drug agencies included: drug use; presenting/primary drug; mode of drug use; frequency of use;  referral source and previous drug treatment. 

Background variables included: sex, residential area, marital status, age, country of birth, Aboriginal/non-Aboriginal, accommodation type, employment status, number of children under 18 and number of children under 18 living with the client.</s:comment>

The survey asked for details of tertiary or professional courses undertaken since graduation, reasons for undertaking further study, details of employment since graduating, salary  in the last year, difficulties in finding the first job after graduating, the respondent&#39;s perceptions of the value of his/her degree, requirements of and opportunities in present job, and whether the respondent is seeking a different position.  Background variables include age, sex, non-English speaking background, aboriginal background, marital status, number of children, type of high school attended, type of qualification, and whether the respondent was a full-time or part-time student.  Graduates who had enrolled as mature age students were also asked how they had entered their course, why they had undertaken the course, whether they had worked during their degree, whether they had obtained the type of work and salary they had hoped for, how difficult they found the study process, and whether they felt that their age or sex had affected their ability to obtain work or their progression at work.</s:comment>

<s:label>Rights in Australia 1991-1992: National Household Sample</s:label>
<s:comment>The principal objectives of the Rights in Australia project were: to establish the level of support for civil liberties and civil rights among Australians; to determine the firmness or solidity of Australians&#39; attitudes to civil liberties; to explore how Australians make up their mind in specific civil liberties controversies, especially where there are competing sides to a situation; and to identify principal characteristics which might affect the support or rejection of certain civil liberties.  This data release represents the first stage in the project: the surveying of a representative sample of the Australian population. The second stage (ASSDA No. 619) comprises interviews with a &#39;decision makers&#39; sample - individuals from three groups, the legislature, the judiciary and the executive (public servants, public prosecutors and police officers).

The household survey consisted of a telephone interview, followed by a questionnaire distributed by mail.  The telephone interview began with questions designed to establish a general measure of the respondent&#39;s attitudes to equality of rights and tolerance of actions against the government.  This was followed by a section dealing with more specific rights issues - freedom of speech, racial discrimination, and freedom of choice, including censorship, euthanasia, abortion and homosexuality.  Further sections dealt with: legal rights - right to trial, right to trial by jury, contact with the police; sexual discrimination; racial prejudice towards Asians and Aboriginals; and the issue of a Bill of Rights for Australia.  The mail survey consisted of additional questions covering the same range of issues.  In the telephone interview, background information was collected on political orientation, vote at last election, interest in politics and compulsory voting.

Demographic information collected about the respondent included age, sex, country of birth and year of arrival in Australia, citizenship status, age starting and leaving school, type of school attended, highest qualification, religion and frequency of church attendance, marital status, numbers of children and numbers in the household, occupation and labour force status, trade union membership and household income.</s:comment>

<s:label>National Drug Strategy Household Survey, 1995</s:label>
<s:comment>This study is the fifth in a series of National Household Surveys to examine current attitudes towards drugs and drug problems, usage of drugs, and to assess changes in these attitudes and usage over the period 1985-1995. The four earlier studies were Social Issues in Australia, 1985; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1988; the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1991; and the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey, 1993; and supplement was also carried out targeting the urban Aboriginal population in 1994. This survey is also the first survey in the National Drug Strategy Household Survey series which has followed on from the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse Social Issues Survey Series.

As with the previous surveys in the series, the questionnaire asked respondents about their degree of concern about various social issues and drugs. A sealed section of the questionnaire allowed respondents to indicate their usage of each drug without the interviewer being aware of their answers. The drugs covered were: alcohol, amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine/crack, ecstasy/designer drugs, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants (eg. glue, petrol), marijuana/hash, pain killers/analgesics, steroids, tobacco/cigarettes and tranquillisers. Respondents were also asked if they had been victims of physical and/or verbal abuse and property damage and/or theft by someone affected by alcohol or had themselves committed these offences when under the influence. This survey also includes extra questions on health, marijuana attitudes, and co-use of drugs.

Background variables included geographical location, sex, age group, birthplace, employment status and occupation of self and spouse, education status, and the number and ages of other people in the household.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 1987</s:label>
<s:comment>The study has two goals. The first is to continue the broad line of enquiry established by the 1967 and 1979 Australian National Political Attitudes surveys so that patterns of stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate can be traced over two decades. The second is to assess the electoral impact of forces specific to this election in order better to understand its outcome.

Respondents were asked which party they voted for in the 1987 and 1984 Federal elections; when they had decided how to vote and whether they might have changed their vote; party identification; interest in politics; the importance of a number of issues and the media in deciding their vote; left-right positions for their own views and those of the major parties in the 1987 and 1984 elections; feelings about the party leaders indicated by ratings from 0 to 10, their qualities and effectiveness as prime minister. A section on election issues covered perceptions of Australia&#39;s current economic situation and the extent of the effect of government policies on the economy; government spending; privatisation; the role of trade unions and big business; uranium mining; law and order; Asian migration; marijuana; abortion; aborigines; testing for AIDS; censorship; homosexuality; opportunities for women. Other questions examined trust in government; political goals; and forms of political action.

Background information included level of schooling; highest level of qualification; current activity; occupation; employment sector; supervision; union membership; self assessed social class; sex; age; length of current residence; country of birth of self  and parents; year arrived in Australia; father&#39;s occupation; parents&#39; schooling and political preference; marital status; number of children; partner&#39;s schooling, occupation, employment sector, supervision, union membership and political preference; religion and attendance at religious services.</s:comment>

<s:label>Australian Election Study, 1990</s:label>
<s:comment>The Australian Election Study is the second in the series initiated in 1987, and builds on the data collected earlier in the 1967 and 1979 Australian Political Attitudes Surveys. The series provides a long-term perspective on stability and change in the political attitudes and behaviour of the Australian electorate, and investigates the changing social bases of Australian politics as the economy and society modernise and change character. In addition to these long-term perspectives it examines the political issues prevalent in the election and assesses their importance for the election result. 

Two major themes are covered in the survey, the economy and the environment. Questions on the economy include retrospective and prospective evaluations of the country&#39;s economy and the individual&#39;s own personal household situation; wages and price controls; attitudes to particular economic issues; and the position of the major parties and party leaders on the main economic issues. Questions on the environment include attitudes to the protection of the environment and to environmental issues in general; the role of industry and the government in ensuring environmental protection; rankings of the most urgent environmental issues and the respondent&#39;s assessment of their likely future importance; and attitudes toward environmental pressure and interest groups, including current or likely membership.  

As in the 1987 AES, a range of questions are included in the survey which cover election issues and the respondent&#39;s assessment of the most effective party to handle them, as well as questions on specific political issues such as government spending and the pilots&#39; dispute. A section on social policy includes questions on around 30 contemporary social and moral issues, including abortion, Aboriginal rights, pornography, health care and many others. A section on industrial policy focuses on attitudes towards the control of the economy, attitudes to trade unions and big business, and to industrial conflict in general. In addition to the standard questions on vote in the current election, recalled vote in the 1987 federal election, and party identification, the survey contains an extensive section dealing with attitudes to the major parties and to the party leaders. Finally, a range of demographic data are collected for each respondent and their spouse or partner, if applicable.</s:comment>

<s:label>Cancer of the cervix: evaluation of a screening campaign, 1993</s:label>
<s:comment>The National Centre of the Cervix Screening Policy was developed following a report made by the Cervical Cancer Screening Evaluation Steering Committee of the Australian Health Minister&#39;s Advisory Council.  The evaluation called for an organised approach to screening for cancer of the cervix based on an agreed national policy.  The resulting policy states that all asymptomatic women aged 18-70 who are, or who have ever been, sexually active should have biennial Pap Smears.

The Cancer of the Cervix campaign was developed as a strategy to communicate the aims of this policy to Australian women.  National pre and post-campaign surveys were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign in providing women with information about the policy, specifically information regarding Pap Smears and the need for biennial screening.

Respondents were asked whether they had heard of Pap Smear tests; if they had observed any advertising and/or other information on Pap Smears; what they thought the tests were used to detect; the plausibility of reasons for not having Pap Smears; their own reason for not having a Pap Smear; how often they had had Pap Smears in the past and how often they propose to have them in the future; the age and reason when Pap Smears are no longer needed; and whether they had had an abnormal Pap Smear result.

Background variables include age, whether the respondent is of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent; whether English is the main language spoken in the household; marital status; highest level of education; occupation; annual income; and occupation and annual income of the main income earner.</s:comment>
