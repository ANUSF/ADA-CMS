<s:label>Tertiary education for rural and remote area health workers, 1992</s:label>
<s:comment>Rural and remote areas of Australia suffer from inadequate rates of recruitment of health workers and low rates of retention.  This may partly be attributed to professional isolation experienced by health workers in these areas, while they require a wide range of professional skills.  The aim of this survey was to review current post-secondary education opportunities for rural and remote area health workers.  The database would be used to evaluate deficiencies in programs for rural health with particular reference to those involved in areas of alcohol related problems, child abuse, sexual assault and domestic violence.

The data set consists of information about post-secondary courses which are available and relevant to rural and remote area health workers.  It was designed to be relevant to all types of health workers including medical practitioners, registered and enrolled nurses, aboriginal health workers, counsellors, social workers, pharmacists, dentists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, ambulance personnel, community workers, and other allied health and welfare workers.  The data include courses/units specifically orientated to the conditions of health service delivery in rural and remote areas, and courses/units which may be recommended for, or interesting to, rural and remote area health workers.   One data file lists each such course, giving details of the institution, contact person, subject, award level, prerequisities, requirements for attendance, and possibilities for part-time or external study. The second data file lists each unit with information about the course title, unit title, year, semester,  and course credit.
